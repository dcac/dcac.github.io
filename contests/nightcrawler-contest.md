***Dear Creatures of the Night,***

Were you made for the graveyard shift? Great! Then we’d like to introduce you to the CEO of Video Production News, Lou Bloom.

Curious? Check out his [LinkedIn profile](http://linkd.in/1o1EL09). Like you, Lou is a hard worker, sets high goals, and is very persistent.  His motto is: if you want to win the lottery, you have to make the money to buy a ticket!

Unless of course, you have generous friends like Dear Cast and Crew, who give tickets out for free! And if you live in one of the following cities:

**Toronto**  
**Ottawa**  
**Halifax**  
**Edmonton**  
**Calgary**  
**Victoria**  
**Vancouver**
**Winnipeg**

To win a pair double passes to see **NIGHTCRAWLER on Oct. 29th**, featuring Lou Bloom in action, enter below.

Good luck!
