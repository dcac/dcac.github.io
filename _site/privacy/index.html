We the producers of dearcastandcrew.com believe that electronic privacy is crucial for the ongoing success of the Internet as a commercial and entertainment medium and society as a whole. We know you&#39;re concerned about protecting your privacy online.</p> <p>At dearcastandcrew.com (“DearCastandCrew” or “we”), we respect and are committed to protecting your privacy, and have a general policy of openness about how we collect, use and disclose your personal information. This DearCastandCrew Privacy Policy (“Policy”) informs you how DearCastandCrew collects, uses and discloses the personal information that you provide to us through use of our website and explains how you can contact us if you have a question about our Policy. This Policy applies to DearCastandCrew’s websites and governs data collection and usage at all DearCastandCrew sites and services.</p> <p>At DearCastandCrew, we only collect and use personal information as necessary to do business with you or to assess your suitability for employment. We do not disclose your personal information, except in accordance with this Policy or as required by law. We recommend that you take the time to read this Policy so that you understand how we handle and process your personal information. As we develop and expand our products and services, this Policy may change. We will include a &quot;last amended&quot; date on the Policy as displayed on the website. </p> <p>Should you have any questions or concerns regarding this Policy or how we collect, use or disclose your personal information, please contact us at <a href="mailto:info@dearcastandcrew.com">info@dearcastandcrew.com</a>.</p> <h2>Consent</h2> <p>By submitting personal information to DearCastandCrew or its agents through this website, you agree that we may collect, use and disclose this information in accordance to this policy and as permitted or required by law. Subject to legal and contractual requirements, you may refuse or withdraw your consent to certain of the identified purposes at any time by contacting us. If you refuse or withdraw your consent, we may not be able to provide you or continue to provide you with certain services or information that may be of value to you. If you provide DearCastandCrew or our agents with personal information of another individual, you represent that you have all necessary authority and/or have obtained all necessary consents from such person to enable us to collect, use and disclose such personal information for the purposes set forth in this Policy.</p> <p>Changes to this Policy will be posted and will only apply to activities and information on a going forward, not retroactive basis. You are encouraged to review the privacy policy whenever you visit the site to make sure that you understand how any personal information you provide will be used.</p> <h2>Collection of Your Personal information</h2> <p>Canadian privacy legislation defines personal information broadly as information about an identifiable individual or as information that allows an individual to be identified. The types of personal information that DearCastandCrew may collect from you from time to time include personal contact information (address, email address, telephone number); date of birth; professional credentials; hobbies and interests; account information; and customer relationship information, such as customer requests and feedback information requested or provided by or from you.</p> <p>There may also be information about your computer hardware and software that is automatically collected by DearCastandCrew and may be shared with others. This information can include: your IP address, browser type, domain names, access times, and referring website addresses. This information is used by DearCastandCrew for the operation of the service, to maintain quality of the service, and to provide general statistics regarding use of the DearCastandCrew websites.</p> <p>DearCastandCrew attempts to ensure that collection of personal information is limited to that which is necessary to fulfill the identified purposes for which it is collected and that your personal information will be used only for such purposes.</p> <p>DearCastandCrew encourages you to review the privacy statements of websites you choose to link to from DearCastandCrew so that you can understand how those websites collect, use, and share your information. DearCastandCrew is not responsible for the protection of personal information collected, used and disclosed through websites accessible through the DearCastandCrew websites.</p> <h2>Use of Your Personal Information</h2> <p>We collect personal information about you to enable us to improve our business and operations. More specifically, we collect, use and disclose your personal information: (i) to establish, maintain and manage our client relationships in order to provide products and services that have been requested; (ii) to be able to inform you of our products or services other than those that have been specifically requested, including sending you information promoting other DearCastandCrew products or services; (iii) to be able to comply with your requests or inquiries; (iv) to understand and respond to your needs and preferences, including to contact and communicate with you and to conduct surveys, research and evaluations; (v) as part of our online employment application and recruitment process; and (vi) for any other purpose to which you give consent.</p> <p>As part of the employment application process, DearCastandCrew will collect personal information about you, including your name, home address, telephone number, personal email address, date of birth, and information related to your educational and employment background. This information is used to assess suitability for employment within our organization and will not be used for any other purpose.</p> <h2>Disclosure of Your Personal Information</h2> <p>From time to time, DearCastandCrew may disclose your personal information for the purposes described in this Policy or for any additional purposes for which we have obtained your consent. DearCastandCrew may share your personal information with our employees, contractors, consultants and other parties who require such information to assist us with establishing, maintaining and managing our relationship with you.</p> <p>DearCastandCrew <strong>does not</strong> sell, rent, or lease its customer, job applicant, or subscriber lists to third parties. DearCastandCrew may, from time to time, contact you on behalf of external business partners about a particular offering that may be of interest to you. In those cases, your unique personally identifiable information (email, name, address, telephone number) is not transferred to the third party. In addition, DearCastandCrew may share data with trusted partners to help us perform statistical analysis. All such third parties are prohibited from using your personal information except to provide these services to DearCastandCrew, and they are required to maintain the confidentiality of your information.</p> <p>DearCastandCrew keeps track of the websites and pages our customers visit within DearCastandCrew websites, in order to determine what DearCastandCrew websites and services are the most popular. This data may be used to deliver customized content to customers that are interested in a particular subject area.</p> <p>In addition to those reasons set forth in this Policy, DearCastandCrew will disclose your personal information, without notice, if required to do so by law or in the good faith belief that such action is necessary to: (a) conform to the edicts of the law or comply with legal process served on DearCastandCrew or the site; (b) protect and defend the rights or property of DearCastandCrew, a DearCastandCrew website; and (c) act under exigent circumstances to protect the personal safety of users of DearCastandCrew, its websites, or the public.</p> <h2>Cookies</h2> <p>Like other amazing review websites and similar commercial properties, DearCastandCrew uses &quot;cookies&quot; to help you personalize your online experience. A cookie is a text file that is placed on your hard disk by a web page server. Cookies cannot be used to run programs or deliver viruses to your computer. Cookies are uniquely assigned to you, and can be read only by a web server in the domain that issued the cookie to you.</p> <p>One of the primary purposes of cookies is to provide a convenience feature to save you time. The purpose of a cookie is to tell the web server that you have returned to a specific page. For example, if you register with DearCastandCrew websites or services, a cookie helps to recall your specific information on subsequent visits. This simplifies the process of recording your personal information. When you return to the same DearCastandCrew website, the information you previously provided can be retrieved, so you can easily use the DearCastandCrew features that you customized.</p> <p>You have the ability to accept or decline cookies. Most web browsers automatically accept cookies, but you can usually modify your browser setting to decline cookies if you prefer. If you choose to decline cookies, you may not be able to fully experience the interactive features of the DearCastandCrew services or websites you visit.</p> <p>Especially for video content and other similar data, you may be required to enable cookies in order to utilize the Website. Our advertisers may also use cookies to ascertain how many times you have seen an advertisement. Our advertisers and we may use this information to better personalize the content, banners, and promotions that you see on the Website. Such third party use of cookies is subject to that party&#39;s own privacy policies which may differ from ours. You can choose whether to accept cookies by changing the settings of your browser. You can reset your browser to refuse all cookies, or allow your browser to show you when a cookie is being sent. If you choose not to accept these cookies, your experience at the Website and other websites may be diminished and some features may not work as intended. You should consult with your browser&#39;s provider/manufacturer if you have any questions regarding disabling cookies.</p> <h2>Subscribers</h2> <p>The Dissolve may, from time to time, publish a newsletter or other periodical document. In order to receive a copy of this document, we will ask you for certain personally-identifying information including, without limitation, your name, postal and e-mail addresses, and possibly other demographic or personal information. In order to discontinue receipt of the newsletter, periodical, or such other document, simply unsubscribe through the manner prescribed in the last such document you received. We may use this information internally to measure the readership of any given newsletter or periodical.</p> <h2>Control Your Personal Information</h2> <p>Subject to legal or contractual restrictions and reasonable notice, you may change or withdraw your consent at any time by contacting us at the address indicated below. In some circumstances, a change in or withdrawal of consent may severely limit our ability to provide products, services or information that you requested or that could be offered to you. All communications with respect to such withdrawal or variation of consent should be in writing and addressed to Info@dearcastandcrew.com.</p> <h2>Security of Your Personal Information</h2> <p>To help protect the confidentiality of your personal information, DearCastandCrew employs administrative, technological and procedural safeguards that are appropriate to the sensitivity of the personal information. We operate secure data networks protected by industry standard firewall and password protection systems. Uses and disclosures of personal information by external individuals and organizations acting on behalf of DearCastandCrew are governed by contracts that require personal information to be protected appropriately.</p> <h2>Accessing Your Personal Information</h2> <p>Upon written request, subject to certain exceptions, DearCastandCrew will inform you of the existence, use, and disclosure of your personal information and will give you access to that information. Access requests should be sent to Info@dearcastandcrew.com. When requesting access to your personal information, we may request specific information from you to enable us to confirm your identity and right to access, as well as to search for and provide the personal information that we hold about you. We may charge you a fee to access your personal information to cover our costs. That would be awful, and we don’t want to have to do it, but it might be necessary. In any case, we will advise you of any fees in advance.</p> <p>Your right to access your personal information is not absolute. Applicable law or regulatory requirements allow or require us to deny you access: (i) where access would inhibit the ability of DearCastandCrew to comply with a legal obligation; (ii) where it has already been destroyed due to legal requirements or because we no longer need it for our business purposes; or (iii) where access would reveal personal information about a third party. In the event that we cannot provide you with access to your personal information, we will inform you of the reasons, subject to any legal or regulatory restrictions.</p> <h2>Changes to This Policy</h2> <p>DearCastandCrew will occasionally update this Policy. When DearCastandCrew posts changes to this Policy, you will see the word &quot;updated&quot; with the corresponding update date at the bottom of this Policy. If there are material changes to this Policy or in how DearCastandCrew will use your personally identifiable information, DearCastandCrew will prominently post such changes prior to implementing the change. DearCastandCrew encourages you to periodically review this Policy to be informed of how DearCastandCrew is protecting your information.</p> <p>This Policy does not create or confer upon any individual any rights, or impose upon DearCastandCrew any rights or obligations outside of, or in addition to, any rights or obligations imposed by Canada’s federal and provincial privacy laws, as applicable. Should there be, in a specific case, any inconsistency between this Policy and Canada’s federal and provincial privacy laws, this Policy shall be interpreted in a manner to give effect to, and comply with, such privacy laws.</p> <h2>Contact Information</h2> <p>DearCastandCrew welcomes your comments regarding this Policy.
