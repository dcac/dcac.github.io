Redmond","profiled":true,"email":"christopher@dearcastandcrew.com","twitter":"film500","image":"dude.png","bio":"During a nomadic childhood, Christopher used to pad his letters to friends with personal film reviews. They made the envelopes impressively thick and, in his mind, more valuable. Then at 23, he landed his first paid film position as the Assistant (to the) Executive Producer of a movie-of-the-week. The dream had finally become a reality. And that reality slowly became a little too real. So for 2011, Christopher successfully retreated back into fantasy with Film500 – where he watched and reviewed 500 feature films in one year. Take that, real world."},"addressee":"Arnaud Hemery","position":"Data Manager"}]}
