				<title>Fifty Shades of Grey</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I mean, really. Why even bother showing up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was no doubt  exciting when the &lt;em&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey&lt;/em&gt; filmmakers first chose you as they’re own Christian Grey – a confident, experienced man to guide them through the pain-for-pleasure world of BDSM. You probably stroked your whip, fondled your chains, and tugged your rope in anticipation. Oh, the things you were going to show them. But how soon did you realize that Hollywood is even more of a cold-clam than Anastasia Steele?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe they lead you on for a while. Even I felt slightly seduced (or at least amused) by the film initially. There was a playfulness to director Sam Taylor-Johnson’s touch – a warmth and self-awareness that forgave the cloud of naïveté wavering overhead. After all, audiences aren’t used to erotic thrillers. We know every beat of action movies and romantic comedies, but this was supposed to be different. More adult – sophisticated. As such, my wife and I guided each other through the complex and prolonged foreplay sequences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The grey pencil in her mouth represents his PENIS!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The rain represents how WET he makes her! Pathetic phallic-cy!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, making these remarks in a theatre would get us punished. But the long pauses between lines of dialogue almost invited midnight movie-ish call-outs. And we weren’t alone. Our advance screening was packed with over 300 women (and 27 men, the security guard told me) buzzing before and during the film. The teenage lip-bitters to our left and fifty shades of grey hairs in front of us were all working through a serious case of the vapors. It almost felt warranted for a while, as the film gently asserts itself with blunt talk and tours of Christian’s playroom (which ultimately feels more like a museum). But it loses any momentum or sense of danger once it finally indulges in the carefully framed, dimly lit, slow-moving sex scenes – showing just enough ass, tits, and pubic hair to feel risqué. You might have been a great help to the props department, but how emasculating it must have felt to never flex your flogging muscles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the 27-year-old billionaire fantasy, however, this is actually a more reasoned first reaction to the leather lifestyle. Dakota Johnson nails the neophyte virginal aura, even if she eventually overdoes her elementary tells. Jamie Dornan also strikes a good balance between mysterious and miserable. The film ironically climaxes during the contract negotiation scene, where they at least &lt;em&gt;talk&lt;/em&gt; about NSFW butt plugs, genital clamps, and fisting (both vaginal and anal). This clinical consent sequence (which is the entire storyline, actually) is all done with tongue-in-whatever-cheek so pretty much anyone will feel miles away from needing a safe word. As a beginner’s guide to bondage, I can see the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that ending. A quick scan of the synopsis online tells me the script stays pretty true to E.L. James’ pop-erotica phenomenon (which I also learned, hilariously started as &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt; fan fiction between Edward and Bella). But it feels like an outright condemnation of you and the people who do BDSM. It’s far from my bag, but I can’t see you getting new business after this. Rather than an exciting foray into the world of gag balls and suspension, it’s a light romp with feathers, blindfolds, and harmless spanking – right up until it goes to an only slightly darker shade of grey, and becomes outraged by the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s, as Christian says, what&amp;#39;s fifty shades of fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Last Days in Vietnam</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Your job involved a very particular type of extraction. You were tasked to find filmed evidence to back up the stories told by people who lived through the harrowing final days before Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese. Some of this footage you sourced from authorities like the Big Three television networks, the National Archives and Associated Press, and some was supplied by the very people involved. Regardless of origin, it must have been difficult to make decisions about which footage stayed in the picture and which didn’t. No doubt there were many ways this story could have been told. In the end, you have to stand by the choices made by the filmmakers and hope that they’re the right ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last Days&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Vietnam&lt;/em&gt; chronicles the final weeks of the American involvement in the Vietnam War, and the chaotic, zero-hour evacuation of U.S. and South Vietnamese citizens from Saigon. It is told from the perspective of the people who were there, mainly the U.S. servicemen, CIA analysts, and pilots. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like me, you must have inwardly rejoiced when you realized filmmaker Rory Kennedy wasn’t interested in investing any time in the Vietnam War’s exhausting origin story. What she wanted from you was right there in the title. With the exception of a few iconic images (helicopters being pushed off an aircraft carrier, desperate evacuees climbing a rickety ladder on what we learn was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the roof of the American embassy), most of the visuals you supply feel remarkably fresh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Kennedy’s pedestrian footage/talking head formula does not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say that the personal accounts described and depicted here aren’t thrilling in their own right. Most of the servicemen involved in helping people escape were acting against direct orders from American Ambassador Graham Martin, who refused to evacuate until Saigon was literally surrounded by the North Vietnamese Army. Your footage supports the servicemen’s play-by-play of how the situation worsened as the diplomatic foot-dragging forced those trapped to resort to the most desperate of measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see incredible scenes of heroism: people racing down a runway after a commercial airliner while the flight crew frantically pulls as many aboard as they can; a South Vietnamese Chinook pilot hovering beside the USS Kirk after dropping off a load of evacuees, then abandoning his aircraft and swimming aboard the carrier. We hear Marines tell us how they were breaking rules, but that they had to do what they felt was right. When you see the tear-streaked, terrified faces waiting inside the cramped American embassy, it’s difficult to disagree with that sentiment. But like the almost forty-year-old footage you relied on, Kennedy’s focus seems a little faded and fuzzy around the edges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some bewildering omissions. Why no interviews with insiders who might have shed light on Ambassador Graham’s reluctance to evacuate? Or with any of the thousands of Vietnamese women married to U.S. servicemen who spent days waiting with their children inside the embassy, hoping for a ride out? Or what about actually &lt;em&gt;going&lt;/em&gt; to Vietnam to talk to those who didn’t make it out? Instead, Kennedy limits &lt;em&gt;Last Days in Vietnam&lt;/em&gt; to a largely white, male, American perspective (forgive me if I have a hard time believing Henry Kissinger, an unreliable narrator if there ever was one, when he says that the number one concern of the White House was saving as many lives as possible). Kennedy’s take on this dark and convoluted quagmire finds its balance somewhere between oblique reportage and post-hoc apologia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, this documentary is part of the PBS series &lt;em&gt;American Experience&lt;/em&gt;, which explicitly states right in the title who the intended audience is. Maybe &lt;em&gt;America’s Last Days&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Vietnam&lt;/em&gt; would have been a more apt description of the film. I find it interesting that Clint Eastwood has been taking flack for playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://theantimedia.org/the-real-american-sniper/&quot;&gt;fast and loose with the facts&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;American Sniper,&lt;/em&gt; but Kennedy’s skewed (and partially taxpayer funded) interpretation of the end of the Vietnam War gets a pass. But hey, jingoism is as jingoism does! Looking forward to twenty-some years from now when PBS can tell me how the Iraq war ended.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wading through those miles of celluloid must have given you a perspective on just how heart-breaking the situation was for both Americans and South Vietnamese trying to escape an escalating humanitarian tragedy. The U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War is largely remembered as a disaster, and despite some genuine heroics, the ending was just as bungled and mismanaged as the beginning and the middle. It’s obvious that you and the filmmakers sincerely wanted to honour those who worked in vain to save as many lives as they could. But Kennedy feels too intent on trying to save America’s legacy along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The footage you found was truly exceptional, it’s a shame it was used for a propaganda film.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ida</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m crushing a bit here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is hubris, and then there is having an entire film hinge on the performance of a complete neophyte—an apparently reluctant &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scpr.org/programs/the-frame/2015/02/03/41386/oscars-2015-ida-filmmaker-auditioned-400-actresses/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; at that. But there you are, the title character present in almost every frame of Pawel Pawlikowski’s &lt;em&gt;Ida&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in the Stalinist Poland of 1961, &lt;em&gt;Ida&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a young nun who is coerced by her Mother Superior into confronting her family’s complicated past. Rigorously composed and shot in black and white, the film is somehow also starkly intimate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ida&lt;/em&gt; is a beautiful film, with angular compositions and unconventional framing that manages to be both unsettling and serene. Much of the first act, which is spent in and around the austere silence of the convent, is largely occupied with architectural spaces and exquisitely lit compositions. Humans are often small, almost insignificant elements, sometimes given just the lower third of the frame to occupy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the most jarringly exquisite film I have ever seen. The complexity and power of each image tends to feel overwhelming initially. It is like viewing an endless series of beautifully composed photos and it threatens to overshadow the rather slender narrative. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What prevents the film from being buried by the stark power of its own images and transforms it into a story that is compelling, as well as tragic, is your interaction with the last surviving member of your long lost family—your aunt. She is a character, in the absolute best sense of that word, played ferociously by Agata Kulesza. A ruthless Communist apparatchik of unquestioned vigor as well as a hard-drinking atheist possessed of none of the restraint that seems to exude from you like a subtle perfume, she is also your guide into the labyrinth that is your family history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second act, &lt;em&gt;Ida&lt;/em&gt; becomes this poignant, and sometimes bleakly funny, road movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still perfectly composed and allowing for each moment to play out with remarkable patience, it transforms into a gritty, neo-realist trip into rural, post-war Poland. Both women have a particular gravitational pull that affects each other as well as those around them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kulesza gives an extraordinary performance—at turns bombastic and then almost witheringly despondent—but it is counterbalanced by your intuitive stillness and precocious dignity. These are two of the most arresting characters I have experienced this last year and despite the short run time (80 minutes), I feel like I know something important about each of these women by the end of the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Ida&lt;/em&gt; evokes comparison to other works (Dreyer’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3Q6FVhqLY0&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Passion of Joan of Arc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as just one example), it is entirely its own thing, and that is partially owing to your performance. You are both enigmatic and completely transparent, and every moment the camera spends on you, it is still never enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ida&lt;/em&gt; is also another example of the quiet renaissance that we are almost surreptitiously experiencing these days. Perhaps somewhat hidden by the shadow of the summer tent poles and the cries of doom and gloom, diverse filmmakers like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/1/20/a-most-violent-year.html&quot;&gt;JC Chandor&lt;/a&gt; and Pawlikowski, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/10/29/nightcrawler.html&quot;&gt;Dan Gilroy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Drop&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; Michael R. Roskam are all creating superb, mid-budget films that are head and shoulders above most of the dreck of the last fifteen or twenty years. &lt;em&gt;Ida&lt;/em&gt; is an entirely uncontroversial nominee for an Academy Award, and these days that is saying something indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it seems like Pawlikowski was indeed correct when he insisted on your participation. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Jupiter Ascending</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I recognized you right away. I can spot a lone Python in the wild with the precision of a non-migratory African swallow. It wasn’t your wispy Einstein hair, unkempt beard, or mischievous, darting eyes that gave you away. It wasn’t even the familiar grumbles or snorts you made while issuing official documents from a steampunk-inspired Rube Goldberg contraption. The whole scene&amp;#39;s homage to your 1985 opus &lt;em&gt;Brazil&lt;/em&gt; predicted your arrival. It was at that moment that I realized just how much you and The Wachowskis have in common as filmmakers. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because - and I say this with absolute respect to all parties involved - &lt;em&gt;Jupiter Ascending&lt;/em&gt; is a mess. A spectacular, giddy, sprawling, hot mess.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the uninitiated, &lt;em&gt;Brazil&lt;/em&gt; is a movie about a future overtaken by bureaucracy (now, it&amp;#39;s a training film for all new employees at Bell call centres). It satirizes and even celebrates the labyrinthine, so you must have felt right at home reading the script for &lt;em&gt;Jupiter Ascending.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The plot reads like the peyote-fuelled fever dream of a sci-fi nerd who stayed up for a week watching camp classics like &lt;em&gt;Dune,&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Soylent Green&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Spaceballs&lt;/em&gt;  on a loop. Jupiter Jones is a housecleaner who unknowingly contains the DNA of the dead royal matriarch from a distant galaxy. The dead queen’s children fight over their inheritance which includes Earth and its inhabitants who are being harvested for a youth serum for the galaxy’s elites. Genetically engineered ex-soldier Caine Wise is sent to protect Jupiter from Balem, the eldest of the royals who wants to kill Jupiter so she will lose her claim to Earth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Did you know right away that you wanted in? Like you, Andy and Lana Wachowski love to cram the screen with mesmerizing visuals; a thrilling chase scene through the Chicago night sky, the Rococo royal palace filled with women dressed like Vegas showgirls, and a galactic dogfight where planets and ships look like gaudy jewels against a velvet backdrop. The effects are as dizzying as the characters, and just as over the top. Eddie Redmayne channels Gary Oldman in &lt;em&gt;Fifth Element&lt;/em&gt; (and &lt;em&gt;Bram Stoker’s Dracula&lt;/em&gt;) as the scenery chewing, bare-chested villain Balem. Channing Tatum’s Caine might be part dog, but he’s all man to Mila Kunis’ cartoony Jupiter Jones. There are giant lizard minions (reminiscent of yours in &lt;em&gt;Fear &amp;amp; Loathing In Las Vegas&lt;/em&gt;), an egg-harvesting sub-plot, and Sean Bean living in a beehive.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have to be honest, before you made your appearance, I wasn’t really sure what the Wachowskis were up to. Until then I was awed by the jaw-dropping effects yet frustrated by the over-baked plot. But when Jupiter has to claim her royal status on a new planet, and is given a droid named Advocate Bob to herd her through the serpentine bureaucratic process (which is how she meets you), I got wise to their game. &lt;em&gt;Jupiter Ascending&lt;/em&gt; is the kind of movie you would make if you were ever given a budget larger than the one the Wachowskis spend on craft services. It’s a campy, cheesy, gleeful tribute to the space opera, an episode of &lt;em&gt;Flash Gordon&lt;/em&gt; with a limitless bank account. All that’s missing is Freddie Mercury screeching &lt;em&gt;“Jupiter&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;ahhh! Savior of the universe!”&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Wachowskis are as guilty as you have been of falling a little too in love with visuals at the expense of the pace, which in places drags under the weight of all that eye candy. The love story between Jupiter and Caine is obvious but adorable, and offers many of the film’s comedic moments. This film is almost perversely goofy, even when it tries to be serious about consumption, commodification and human enslavement. And yet it’s still unambiguously fun. In the not too distant future, I could see &lt;em&gt;Jupiter Ascending&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;12 Monkeys&lt;/em&gt; sharing a midnight double-feature bill. For now, this film just has to be patient for its inevitable bestowment of cult classic status.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a shame you and the Wachowskis suffer from the same curse; being constantly, maybe even irrationally, held to the standard of your most universally adored films. &lt;em&gt;The Matrix&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Brazil&lt;/em&gt; are flukes, beloved cinematic freaks of nature that managed to capture the imaginations of audiences and critics to be rightfully assured a place in film history. As filmmakers, it’s not something you could duplicate even if you wanted to. Your die-hard fans know this. We will always line up to see what you’ve done because even when you fail, you fail spectacularly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Jupiter Ascending&lt;/em&gt; is the kind of movie people will either love, or love to hate. I loved its frivolity, pageantry and playfulness. But most of all I loved its ambition. Without ambition, we’d all just be mindless administrative drones, forever chasing the elusive 27 B stroke 6.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Mr. Turner</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Making great art about great art is always a precarious endeavor. Impossible, some might argue. Which is why so many films about the work of great artists fixate on process: the how, the where, the when—anything that can be quantified. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When it comes to the more subjective stuff – the art itself – a bit of ambiguousness is often necessary to maintain the illusion of sublimity. In &lt;em&gt;Mr. Turner&lt;/em&gt;, you and your longtime collaborator, writer/director Mike Leigh, approach this dilemma in a rather unique way: by treating Turner’s great art like an element of set design or an object from the props department. It sits off-center, out-of-focus, setting a mood or invoking a feeling, but never fully occupying the foreground.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your lush and languorous portrait of preeminent British painter JMW Turner has much in common with a painted portrait: it’s inert, fastidious, captivating. Turner, the man, occupies virtually every frame of the film: standing in silhouette as he sketches a crepuscular landscape; strolling along the beaches of Northern England; posing with deathly stillness for a daguerreotype. As embodied by Timothy Spall – who looks, here, like an Edward Gorey drawing of a Lewis Carroll character – he is a compelling presence, moving with a gorilla’s mean agility, speaking in a language of phlegmy growls and grunts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;His artwork is much less prominent. When we do see it, it’s usually from an oblique angle, or from afar, or partially obscured. When the art critic John Ruskin arrives with his father to inspect a painting, the camera stays behind the canvas, and we’re forced to conjure the image in our minds based only on Ruskin’s descriptive evangelizing. Never once do we get that intimate artist’s perspective; there are no loving close-ups of the brush wetly caressing the canvas, no balletic flurry of strokes set to inspiring music. There’s little magic in Turner’s creative process—at least not in the way you express it in this film. He spits and scrapes and blows powdered paint, and does it with the dispassion of a cobbler or cooper. Indeed, he seems to approach painting as a trade. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As cinematographer, you had to overcome a few dilemmas specific to &lt;em&gt;your&lt;/em&gt; trade: how to shoot the vistas and landscapes that inspired Turner’s canvases. There is digital trickery involved, to be sure—in one scene, as Turner is paddling along the Thames with his artist pals, the reverse shot is a near-exact recreation of his painting “The Fighting Temeraire tugged to her last berth to be broken up.” The image is radiant, otherworldly, gorgeous, but has the peculiar effect of diminishing the resultant work of art; it makes the process seem too easy, too elementary, like a simple transposition of what Turner sees. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is exactly the kind of misstep that you and Leigh so deftly avoid in so many other parts of the film. When Turner lashes himself to the mast of a ship in order to witness firsthand the eye of a storm, the camera doesn’t move from its fixed place in front of him. We see Turner, wild-eyed, pummeled by hailstones, but we never see what he sees. Later, as we see him swirling his brush to create the curling smoke plume at the center of “Snow Storm: Steam-Boat off a Harbour&amp;#39;s Mouth”, we can easily make the connection between those two moments, and how one influenced the other. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Without additional historical context, one might leave the film feeling like Turner was a minor figure in Victorian art, and not, as he came to be known, one of the great masters of British landscape painting (he was known as the “Painter of Light” long before Thomas Kinkade trademarked that epithet to market his Disney-themed atrocities). Is it a failing of the film that Turner’s place in history is never quite established? That the evolution of his style, which, like the paintings he creates, occurs so subtly that it’s almost invisible?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, not really. The film is purposely impressionistic in the same way that Turner’s later work veered towards (and in many ways prefigured) the principles and methods of the impressionism movement. One must keep in mind that you and Leigh are painting a portrait, not a landscape, and that everything on the periphery must stay there. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Great art is all about clarity of purpose, and it’s clear that, in shooting this film, you possessed it. Turner would surely offer a grunt of approval.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Leviathan</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;As far as pre-Oscar buzz goes, you can’t beat a story about a foreign film facing public outrage and censorship in its home country. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Andrey Zvyagintsev’s three hour-long  &lt;em&gt;Leviathan&lt;/em&gt; has been causing quite a stir in Russia. Hailed by some as a masterful &lt;em&gt;j’accuse&lt;/em&gt; directed at the Putin regime and the hijacked institutions that keep it in power, and decried by others as anti-Putin, anti-religious, Russo-phobic propaganda. After seeing the film, I can’t really place myself firmly in either camp. Yes, the film is critical of many things,but it isn’t exactly _anti- anything in the manner of most politically-driven works. It’s a bit more complicated than that. There’s a lot going on, a lot being said, and the film shifts so imperceptibly in tone and theme that you don’t realize until near the end that a bait-and-switch has occurred.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In a small northern fishing village, Kolya, a mechanic, enlists the help of his lawyer friend, Dmitriy, to defend him against the seizure of his land by Vadim, the mayor. This being a Russian tale, a few things are guaranteed: everyone is going to be miserably cold at all times, they’ll drink a shitload of vodka, and, no matter where the story starts, things will get progressively worse for the protagonist. So of course things don’t go Kolya’s way in court, and he is faced with the loss of his land and ancestral home, which increases the tension in his marriage and causes trouble with his sullen teenaged son. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film sets itself up as a political treatise at the start. The breathtaking, panoramic establishing shots of the mountains and cliffs that surround the village are deceptively pristine, but as your camera takes us further into the village we see images of decay and neglect; then, as we enter Kolya’s house, which, though isolated and run-down on the outside, is warm and feminine on the inside, courtesy of his wife, Lilya. Their home is the only cozy, inviting space in the whole film, which contrasts sharply with the opulence and wealth on display in the spaces occupied by Vadim and his co-conspirator/confessor, the local bishop. Juxtapose religious icons and sinister portraits of Putin (are there any other kind?) with Kolya’s old family photos, and the contrasting indicators clearly delineate good and evil, leaving the audience well-primed for what we think will be Zvyagintsev’s examination of the injustices faced by the average citizen in contemporary Russia, and the corruption eating away at both Church and State. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there is a sudden shift. In one scene, the film becomes about something else entirely. While strolling between vodka benders, Kolya comes across a local priest who advises him to stop fighting the system and have faith that his troubles are all part of a Plan. After all the shit this guy goes through, he’s told to just accept it. And that’s when it hit me: I’d been Job’d. We were being Job’d all along.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, I’ve read my Hobbes and grudgingly done my time in Sunday school, so I had a pretty fair idea as to the thematic concerns I was likely to come across in a film called &lt;em&gt;Leviathan&lt;/em&gt;. But I wasn’t expecting a straight-up retelling of the book of Job, which is, in my opinion, the Old Testament’s most excruciating, table-flippingly frustrating book. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;How did I not see it coming? Your lingering shots of whale skeleton on the beach. Those panoramic mountain views. I became aware of a suffocating sense of inertia. There are moments when even the ocean seems sluggish and inert; the film was suddenly no longer about Putin’s Russia, or the politics of Church and State—it was about the universal plight of people being hammered by insurmountable forces, and the incredibly depressing idea that we are all Kolya, and by extension, Job. And because of the languid, almost lethargic way in which you capture the landscape and move around and in between the characters, the shift from political statement to modern-day religious parable crept up on me quietly and with a complete lack of “a-ha!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given my aforementioned issues with the story of Job, I did experience a moment of dismay when I realized what was up. Yet I’m impressed with how you got me there. Your more straightforward contraposition of wealth/corruption versus poverty/decency sets the scene for the weightier moral and spiritual contemplation to come. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Finding Vivian Maier</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;No one was as close to Vivian Maier as you were. Literally. In every picture we see of Vivian, there you are, slung around her neck or cradled in her hands. The two of you were inseparable. Through you, Vivian was able to communicate her sense of empathy, wit, and macabre humour. Without you, it seems she had a much more difficult time interacting with the world around her. And by all accounts she was perfectly okay with that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2007, filmmaker John Maloof was looking for black and whites for an unrelated project, and bid on a box of old photographs at an auction. In that box, he discovered the work of an unknown street photographer. In &lt;em&gt;Finding Vivian Maier&lt;/em&gt;, Maloof attempts to unravel the mystery of the eccentric nanny who took hundreds of thousands of extraordinary photographs of strangers, yet left behind very few clues about her own life. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maloof (who also wrote, directed, and produced this documentary) knew that he had stumbled upon a gold mine. What you and Vivian were able to achieve together was nothing short of staggering—both in quality and quantity. Her ability to capture the mundane goings-on of American city life in the mid-20th Century is remarkable for its depth of emotion and level of skill. Particularly for someone who, as we find out, had no formal training. She was able to achieve these fascinating candid portraits thanks to you. Your compact design, with the viewfinder on top, meant that Vivian’s subjects often didn’t know she was taking their picture. It allowed her to engage with the subject without being obvious and gave her photographs an almost perverse sense of immediacy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s unfortunate, then, that &lt;em&gt;Finding Vivian Maier&lt;/em&gt; fails to grab the audience with the same level of nuance or whimsy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What we learn about Vivian is revealed through interviews with the families she worked for as a nanny. She is described as mysterious, paradoxical, and, above all, discrete. Though everyone remembers you as being Vivian’s most constant companion (her charges do recall being marched through some of Chicago’s seedier neighbourhoods) no one remembers ever having seen her photographs, and Maloof never bothers to ask. This is a startling exclusion, and at odds with the narrative Maloof seems intent on advancing. Instead he shows us the trunks and suitcases full of film and photos and other cameras that he liberated from her storage unit, lays them out Tetris-like on his floor, and talks about the moral dilemma of exploiting a dead artist, as though daring us to question his aw-shucks sincerity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The closest we get to finding Vivian is through her photographs. Maloof shows some to preeminent photographer Mary Ellen Mark, who compares Vivian’s work to such renowned artists as Diane Arbus, Robert Frank, and Lisette Model. It’s only in these scenes, and the precious few moments when Vivian’s photographs linger onscreen for longer than a second, that provide the most insight into her offbeat behaviour. We are invited to imagine what kind of life the two of you could have led if only Vivian had sought notoriety. The people who knew her best – which they all admit was not very well – unanimously agree that she would have hated this invasion of her privacy, and the very notion of being &lt;em&gt;found.&lt;/em&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We’re supposed to believe that the mystery of Vivian is more interesting than the work itself. But it’s not. When Maloof is not despairing of dealing with the sheer volume of Vivian’s work and getting it the attention it deserves, he is busy forcing intrigue where there is very little to be found. Yes, Vivian was a nanny, who lived austerely and eccentrically, wearing men’s shirts and affecting a muddled European accent, but beyond that she was no weirder than any other prolific artist. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/row-between-collectors-over-discovery-of-works-by-american-photographer-vivian-maier-as-new-documentary-is-released-9615697.html&quot;&gt;The more riveting story is the one Maloof doesn’t tell&lt;/a&gt;, about the controversy surrounding his “discovery” of Vivian, and his refusal to acknowledge that he is not the sole owner of her work. It’s hard not to view &lt;em&gt;Finding Vivian Maier&lt;/em&gt; as a glorified infomercial for The Maloof Collection. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like most co-dependent relationships, yours and Vivian’s wasn’t the healthiest. As she aged, she became increasingly unstable, and eventually left you for a younger model. But in its heyday, your partnership yielded a literal hoard of snapshots of America in its prime. From painted ladies in convertibles to indigent men on strip club stoops, you allowed Vivian to keep a measure of distance between herself and the world, which, in turn, allowed us a deeper insight into its soul. And hers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The only thing &lt;em&gt;Finding Vivian Maier&lt;/em&gt; makes perfectly clear is that Vivian was never lost when she had you.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>American Sniper&#39;s Magic Bullet Theory</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Readers,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;&lt;em&gt;American Sniper&lt;/em&gt; is a big fat box-office hit. It has become a must-see movie, not just for star-spangled flag-wavers, Oscar completionists and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/american-snipers-fake-baby-mocked-764702&quot;&gt;plastic baby fetishists&lt;/a&gt;, but general audiences, too. Yes, the film is a legitimately well-made drama, and can be twisted to fit all sorts of personal and political agendas. But it’s also surprisingly subversive. How? Because the filmmakers suggest that Chris Kyle is a bit of a fraud.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Many journalists, critics, and pundits have dissected Chris Kyle’s actions; whether he was motivated by patriotism, racism, or deeper psychology problems. But no one seems to be talking about how he may have made a lot of this stuff up. Or at least the film allows for that interpretation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Screenwriter Jason Hall takes a bit of creative license and introduces a fictional character – &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/1/16/american-sniper.html&quot;&gt;a rival sniper&lt;/a&gt; – who helps balance out Kyle’s unfair superiority over the enemy, but also weakens what could have been a much more powerful allegory about the unjustness of the American invasion of Iraq. It’s an effective (if not generic) dramatic addition, and justifies Kyle’s need to return, time and time again, to a foreign country that poses no real threat to him or America. But it’s also the narrative device that questions Kyle’s self-identification as a sure-shot protector of the innocent. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film doesn’t try to completely discredit Kyle’s kill count. But in the way it handles the enemy sniper storyline, the film does offer a subtle refutation of his heroic claims. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s easy to buy Kyle’s account of events as they&amp;#39;re dramatized in &lt;em&gt;American Sniper&lt;/em&gt;. In the final battle sequence, director Clint Eastwood shows us the al-Qaeda sniper being shot, and then lingers on the sniper’s dead body. On paper, it sounds like a simple indulgence; an incredulous victory that elevates Kyle to superhero status. He’s a man who can perform the impossible. But look carefully at the sober reactions of the supporting characters and the filming techniques used in this sequence. It&amp;#39;s easy to conclude that Kyle doesn’t actually kill the enemy sniper. He made it up. It was a fantasy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There&amp;#39;s plenty of evidence. When Kyle is being briefed for his last mission, he’s told about a sniper picking off construction engineers on a building downtown. Kyle excitedly asks: “Is it Mustafa?”. But the commander answers with deference: “It can be whoever the fuck you need him to be.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At this point, the audience, like Kyle, are craving a final confrontation. So of course we believe the sniper is Mustafa. But why the mystery? Why not have his commander at least acknowledge the possibility, or agree with the likelihood, of it being Kyle’s proto-antagonist?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The trucks roll out and we get a beautiful aerial shot of Baghdad, trailing behind a drone that flies with dream-like ease. Once above the target building, however, the camera twists, a suspended musical note plays—a signal that things are about to take a turn for the worse. We get the feeling we’re entering a nightmare. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Soon Kyle is on a rooftop, trying to figure out the enemy’s location. Another U.S. soldier is shot. Kyle, realizing he’s made a wrong assumption, scrambles to a new position. The filmmakers aren’t just telling us that Kyle is fallible in his choices, but letting us know that Kyle is literally looking at this situation the wrong way. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Eastwood, however, cuts in close to assure the audience that, yes, of course it’s Mustafa. Phew, right? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyle repositions to a convenient clearing in the roof. Over a mile away from his target, Kyle looks through his scope at the enemy’s probable position. Even through a magnified sight, no one is visible at the other end. Kyle’s commander points this out, and a point-of-view perspective shot reinforces this claim. It’s impossible to see anyone at that distance. When asked for confirmation, we get an even closer view: still, no one is visible. Yet when asked, Kyle confirms, confidently asserting: “Oh, it’s him.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kyle fires, and for the first time in the film Eastwood indulges in a bit of stylized slow-motion. This signals a departure from the grounded, realistic perspective he employs throughout the rest of the film. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We watch the bullet fly into the vast city. Crystal clear. Almost supernatural. But this is because we’re now seeing things through Kyle’s imagined perspective. The camera cuts to Mustafa in profile – also in dream-like slow motion – then we cut back to see the bullet disappear into the distance, out of Kyle’s imagined sight. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The next few shot-reverse-shot close-ups provide the imaginary face-to-face confrontation Kyle craves. Then blood explodes onto a shawl behind the enemy’s head. Kyle, looking into the distance, breathes a sign of relief. A moment later, his satisfaction is interrupted by the reality that he has given away their position to the insurgents below. His commander spells it out: “You just fucked us, Legend.”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As Kyle relaxes, a fellow solider (turned in the opposite direction as Kyle) responds with President Bush’s famously assertive – and premature (ie. wrong) – Iraq War declaration: “Mission accomplished!” The forced enthusiasm stings with irony. Kyle’s magic bullet would make Lee Harvey Oswald jealous. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here, the film goes into full nightmare mode. A sandstorm rages over the final battle, completely obstructing the enemy and obscuring all clarity. This pathetic fallacy is used to muddy the visual palette and reflect a confused state of mind—one that comes from knowing that closure isn’t simply a target you can hit. Especially when you&amp;#39;re lying to yourself about the truth. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But would Eastwood really rely on such misdirection without introducing the idea of an unreliable protagonist sooner? Of course not. The dolly shot when Kyle is at home, staring blankly at a television that isn’t turned on, is another clue that what he sees and what’s happening aren’t always the same thing. We hear the cacophony of a gun battle, but it’s only the echoes in his head. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;At the end of the film, when Kyle has supposedly transformed into a perfect father, he walks into the kitchen with a cocked hand-gun pointed as his wife. She might not sense the danger, but we sure as hell do. This isn’t just foreshadowing of what’s about to happen to Kyle, but a blatant reminder that he’s still unhinged. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even more telling is the sequence right &lt;em&gt;before&lt;/em&gt; the sniper showdown. Look at the way Kyle is framed during the most emotionally charged scene in the film, when a small child picks up an RPG and aims it at U.S. troops. Kyle&amp;#39;s spotter is also in the frame, but sitting back, staring blankly into the sky. This comes, oddly, right &lt;em&gt;after&lt;/em&gt; Kyle has killed a man on the street. The spotter doesn’t even sit up straight and look over the ledge to confirm the kill. Are we supposed to assume that Kyle is so prolific in killing that his fellow soldiers don’t even react anymore? Is this second solider simply bored by war? Or are the filmmakers suggesting another imaginary battle being waged in Kyle’s mind? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The answer lies with the viewer. And that&amp;#39;s the real reason&lt;em&gt;American Sniper&lt;/em&gt; is connecting with so many people. If you look close enough,  Chris Kyle can be “whoever the fuck you need him to be.”&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Whiplash</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;A bravura performance is, by its very nature, exhilarating to behold. And J.K. Simmons, as the despotic music instructor Terrence Fletcher in &lt;em&gt;Whiplash&lt;/em&gt;, indeed gives a bravura performance. He spits verbal abuse like a beatnik R. Lee Ermey, demonstrates a Hannibal Lecter-like capacity for psychological torture, and even attempts to decapitate a student by hurling a cymbal discus-style at the kid’s head. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Rarely, though, does a bravura performance by a member of the post-production crew take center stage the way it does in &lt;em&gt;Whiplash&lt;/em&gt;. From the very first frames, your virtuosic editing asserts itself as a core component of writer/director Damien Chazelle’s aesthetic—and, as the film progresses, it seems to take on a life of its own. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The analogy is almost too easy: the editor as drummer, keeping time, setting pace. But in this film, it’s particularly apt. You never rush, never lag. You’re always right on tempo, even when that tempo is completely syncopated. Like the great jazz musicians around whom &lt;em&gt;Whiplash&lt;/em&gt; builds much of its mythology (to the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.slate.com/blogs/browbeat/2014/10/11/whiplash_charlie_parker_and_the_cymbal_what_the_movie_gets_wrong_about_genius.html&quot;&gt;misguided objections&lt;/a&gt; of some critics), you seem to be improvising a visual solo that runs in phrases and melodies above and beneath and through the raw material provided by writer/director Damien Chazelle and cinematographer Sharone Meir. As Fletcher puts his studio band through the paces, the countless hours of practice are compressed into little mini-montages of close-cropped images: instrument cases are opened and closed, reeds are drained, callouses drip blood. The unease before a big performance is further constricted by similarly disorienting bursts: sheet music is marked, drum keys crank on tension rods, a pair of lips exhales. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sure, these are stylistic (perhaps superfluous) embellishments. But in a jazz performance, no one begrudges such flourishes; it’s what the art form is all about. It’s those unexpected notes that make a thing sublime, unique. Likewise, in &lt;em&gt;Whiplash&lt;/em&gt;, the edits occur where you don’t expect them, and it’s in this polyrhythmic interplay between the images – close and wide, dark and light, fast- and slow-motion – that the film elevates itself. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But you don’t just express your proficiency by showing off in those big moments. Early in the film, when drumming prodigy Andrew Neimann finds himself on an awkward first date, we get a quick glimpse beneath the table as his companion gently brushes her foot against his. For all the bombast elsewhere, this cut is almost invisible; you can hardly believe you weren’t looking at their shoes the whole time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film itself is about bravura performances, and, as you might expect, it culminates with one (the way it unfolds, though, is quite unexpected, so that’s not quite a spoiler). What makes &lt;em&gt;Whiplash&lt;/em&gt; unique in the genre (if one can indeed call the journey-of-the-arts-prodigy narrative its own genre) is the honesty with which it addresses the messy (sometimes bloody) process by which greatness is achieved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“I was there to push people beyond what&amp;#39;s expected of them,” Fletcher tells Neimann. “There are no two words in the English language more harmful than &lt;em&gt;good job&lt;/em&gt;.” I wonder if you had a similar relationship with any of the mentors you worked with early in your career. Maybe David Milch during your time on &lt;em&gt;Deadwood&lt;/em&gt;. Or maybe John Axelrad, who you’ve assisted on numerous films, including two James Gray pictures. Was it one of them who pushed you beyond what was expected of you as an editor? Have either of them ever chucked a hard drive of raw footage at your head? Whatever the case, you’ve certainly found a way to push yourself. And the result is a singular achievement that even a chronically dissatisfied psychopath like Terrence Fletcher could be proud of. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Is it #OscarsSoWhite or just #OscarsSoWrong?</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear America,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Since the Oscar nominations were announced last week, the noticeable lack of diversity among the high profile nominees has become a huge controversy. “The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/films/oscars/oscar-nominations-2015-academy-criticised-for-allwhite-nominees-in-acting-categories-9980457.html&quot;&gt;whitest year&lt;/a&gt; since 1998!” has become a familiar lament. “Selma gets snubbed!” was a headline or sub-head in almost every single Oscar news item of the day. Hands were wrung—not just in self-righteous protest, but in disappointment over the dismissal of a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/1/21/selma.html&quot;&gt;beautifully accomplished film&lt;/a&gt; that could have used the boost in profile.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Selma being overlooked, however, feels less like an institutional crime than one of poor taste. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No one will deny that the &lt;a href=&quot;http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Academy_of_Motion_Picture_Arts_and_Sciences&quot;&gt;Academy’s demographics&lt;/a&gt; don’t reflect the diversity of America. Neither do most of the films that Hollywood makes (not by a &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2014/12/11/these-charts-prove-hollywood-still-has-a-huge-racial-gap/&quot;&gt;long shot&lt;/a&gt;). Clearly that needs to change. However, in nearly two decades, this is &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/oscars-acting-nominees-all-white-764018&quot;&gt;only the second time&lt;/a&gt; acting nominations went exclusively to white actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The disappointment of film fans seems to be focused on David Oyelowo and Ava DuVerany (two relative unknowns), neither of whom received one of the five slots coveted by every film actor and director in the world. It’s a missed opportunity, sure. Especially with such a legitimate chance to nominate (deservedly) the first female Black director. But when the nominees were announced last week, barely anyone had seen &lt;em&gt;Selma&lt;/em&gt;. Yet everyone in the media (social and traditional) wasted no time in crying foul. The road to progress seems to lead, once again, to &lt;em&gt;Selma&lt;/em&gt;—but maybe not in the way that most people think.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The fact the film was nominated in fewer categories than most of us would have liked might paradoxically be a positive sign. This feels like true equal-opportunity outrage, the kind everyone feels when their favorite film is ignored. But it doesn’t feel like an outrage about a &lt;em&gt;lack&lt;/em&gt; of equal opportunity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Last year, the unflinching drama &lt;em&gt;12 Years a Slave&lt;/em&gt; – directed by a Black Brit – took home Best Picture. And for the most part, black movie stars have been fairly represented at the Oscars for the better part of a decade. Jamie Foxx, Forrest Whittaker, Morgan Freeman, Lupita N’yongo, Octvia Spencer, Mo’Nique Imes-Jackson, Jennifer Hudson—all major winners in the last decade (representing 7 of the past 40 acting awards). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From an outsider’s perspective, things don’t necessarily look so grim. At the same time, however, it&amp;#39;s understandable how it might feel like a step backward. Particularly in a year when racial inequality has led to some truly &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.bloomberg.com/politics/articles/2014-12-07/bloomberg-politics-poll-finds-most-americans-see-race-relations-worsening-since-obamas-election&quot;&gt;ugly moments&lt;/a&gt;. Especially when &lt;em&gt;Selma&lt;/em&gt; felt so timely, so worthy. But isn’t it possible that accusations of institutional racism are overblown in the exact same way that accusations were of quota-filling from last year? Isn’t the odd all-white year of actors (say, once a decade) kind of statistically inevitable? Is DuVernay really so unique in being excluded? Remember all the flack about Affleck&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;Argo&lt;/em&gt; snub from a few years ago? Great directors of great films are often overlooked, from Fritz Lang to Christopher Nolan. Not to mention scores of worthy actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the first biopic about Martin Luther King Jr. &lt;em&gt;seemed&lt;/em&gt; to check all the Oscar boxes. Yet it only received a check in two categories. The Academy, apparently, isn’t as predictable as we think. That said, &lt;em&gt;Selma&lt;/em&gt; is nominated for Best Picture in a year where only eight films got that distinction (out of a possible 10). That’s an accomplishment that shouldn’t be diminished. If we’re going to bemoan the short-changing of &lt;em&gt;Selma&lt;/em&gt;, why aren’t we also talking about some of the other minority exclusions? Like Chadwick Boseman’s incredible performance as James Brown in &lt;em&gt;Get On Up&lt;/em&gt;. Or lauding that film’s similar subversion of the biopic formula (just try to watch the first 10 minutes and not be hooked). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In that spirit,, why not share some upset over the fact Jake Gyllenhaal wasn’t nominated for &lt;em&gt;Nightcrawler&lt;/em&gt;. There are no easy answers to explain that blatant omission, either.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Whatever the case, it’s clear that America has reached a point where a great film by a black director, about a great black man, with great performances by great black actors can be overlooked—not because of race, or politics, but because the Academy’s usual poor taste. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s something akin to progress, isn’t it?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincerley,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Dear Cast &amp;amp; Crew&lt;/p&gt;
