				<title>The DUFF</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;A lot has changed since I was in high school. Back in 2000, my “unique” ability to use editing software packed a real punch to my student campaign videos. With the help of a few spinning graphics – KAPOW! I was Batman. I even had a Robin: that slightly awkward friend recruited to make me seem cool. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You know, a DUFF.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The term isn’t mainstream and probably never will be. As an acronym (Designated Ugly Fat Friend), it’s far too front-and-center in all the film’s marketing to ever gain true cultural traction (or a pornographic sub-genre) the way MILF did after &lt;em&gt;American Pie&lt;/em&gt;. But damn if you and the filmmakers don’t try. Through playful graphics, you literally spell out the word (and countless other things) for people throughout the film. Everything is given the early iMovie treatment, with tweets, texts, and imaginary fireworks splashed all over the screen. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No wonder I dug it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mae Whitman also helps, completely owning her starring role as the sub-sexy, totally approachable, literal girl-next-door. Her chiseled neighbour, played by Robbie Amell, is a jackass jock and childhood friend who gets recruited to give her the &lt;em&gt;She’s All That&lt;/em&gt; hair-shake transformation. The story and stock characters continue to evoke every teen comedy ever made since the 80s, right up to the advertising that tells us &lt;em&gt;The DUFF&lt;/em&gt; is this generation’s &lt;em&gt;Mean Girls&lt;/em&gt; (as your graphics stress). And yeah, it might be. Not by redefining anything, but simply by being funny, confident, and accessible. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s the DUFF of teen movies.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But in a world where geeks and geek-culture &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt;does rule the world, that’s not an insult. The more Whitman’s character gets humiliated throughout the film, the more we love her. The “attack ad” videos created by the resident school hottie are complete with auto-tuning and slow-motion – the special sauce of many embarrassment-enhancing viral videos. But it’s the moments when the film doesn’t try to be era-specific that really work. We know exactly where everything is going (the prom), what’s going to happen (a big kiss), and who’s going to end up with who (duh), but be damned if I wasn’t rooting for it all to happen anyway.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The flare you added was nice, but it’s not what makes the film shine.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Birdman&#39;s Win is Bad News for TIFF</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;So you lost another potential feather in your cap. Big deal, right?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, yes, it is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For several years now, the Toronto International Film Festival’s identity has been built around launching “important Oscar films” to the world. It started around 1999, when &lt;em&gt;American Beauty&lt;/em&gt; claimed top prize at both the Oscars and TIFF. The next year, &lt;em&gt;Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon&lt;/em&gt; was the people’s choice winner and a Best Picture nominee. This hot streak went cool until 2008’s &lt;em&gt;Slumdog&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Millionaire&lt;/em&gt;. That’s when things got serious. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Danny Boyle himself &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.torontosun.com/2014/08/08/tiff-2014-a-look-back-at-the-festivals-biggest-champions&quot;&gt;credited the TIFF award&lt;/a&gt; with saving &lt;em&gt;Slumdog&lt;/em&gt; from a straight-to-DVD release, and unfortunately (if not understandably) the praise went straight to your head.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Every year you position yourself as the ideal launching pad for films that hit the sweet-spot between critical and popular appeal. And you aren’t wrong. Every TIFF People’s Choice award winner since &lt;em&gt;Slumdog&lt;/em&gt; has either been nominated or won the Best Picture Oscar (save 2011’s out-of-nowhere and never-heard-from-again &lt;em&gt;Where Do We Go Now?&lt;/em&gt;). But it’s getting harder and harder to claim any pride in those victories—especially when films like &lt;em&gt;The King’s Speech&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;12 Years a Slave&lt;/em&gt; played to most of America’s top critics in Telluride before you were able to debut them. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This year seems to be proving the point. Your 2014 winner, &lt;em&gt;The Imitation Game&lt;/em&gt;, lived up to the promise with a Best Picture nomination, but just couldn’t gather enough steam to be a break-out hit (with either critics or the public). Instead, &lt;em&gt;Birdman&lt;/em&gt; swooped in and took Oscar’s top prize. Or, as you probably remember it, the film that everyone at TIFF lamented they couldn’t see because it had opened the Venice Film Festival.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that’s the problem. Critics, studio reps, and sales agents can only earmark so many festivals each year. Without the prestige of Cannes, bustling market of Berlin, caché of Venice, or discovery-factor of Sundance, you have always struggled to find a true identity. So you’ve opted for size and spectacle, becoming “the people’s festival” where the city’s diverse population stands in for the tastes of the world. But in that big, generic label, you’re getting lost in the shuffle—especially when so many other festivals are doing a better job of launching big films into the marketplace.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sundance has been the biggest success story of the past few years by developing both breakout directors and seasoned visionaries through films like &lt;em&gt;Beasts of the Southern Wild&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Whiplash,&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Boyhood&lt;/em&gt;. The Sundance Labs are also proving to be breading ground of talent, where producers can get an early peek at rising stars. Venice and Telluride are also a more appealing film going experience for critics, curating manageable schedules which prominently feature each of the 20-odd titles (as opposed to the hundreds that play at TIFF).  And then Cannes. Well...it’s Cannes. Even after holding a whole months-long exhibit dedicated solely to the work of David Cronenberg, Toronto’s prodigal son took his latest film &lt;em&gt;Maps to the Stars&lt;/em&gt; to La Croisette for its premiere instead. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Can you blame him, though? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;More than ever, festivals matter. This year, every film nominated for Best Picture premiered at a film festival (compared to &lt;a href=&quot;http://variety.com/2015/film/news/2015-academy-awards-analysis-87th-oscars-who-won-1201440039/&quot;&gt;60-80% in the past five years&lt;/a&gt;). The battle lines are no longer just drawn between studios, but savvy programmers from Cannes, New York, Venice, Sundance, and Telluride. The days when a film could sneak overseas and surprise audiences in North America are over. Online reviews make a film’s reputation, and, for better or worse, it’s virtually set in stone after the first premiere (even if it’s hidden from the public in the high altitudes of Colorado or canals of Venice). You know this all too well, which is why your artistic director, Cameron Bailey, implemented the controversial first weekend rule of TIFF, creating a two-tier status between Toronto world premieres and first-time Toronto screenings.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now you might have to take things even further. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s going to be hard to argue that playing hardball has paid off in the first year, but you’re going to need to do something more than just pack theatres to make a splash in the film world. With the New York Film Festival taking more and more titles every year, Tribeca finding a groove, SXSW becoming a hub of innovation, and a slew of other festivals carving out niches, the “people’s festival” needs to do more than play the imitation game with Oscar winners if it wants to remain important.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Still Alice</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I was curious to see how they would do it. How would the filmmakers of &lt;em&gt;Still Alice&lt;/em&gt; show the audience what it feels like to have early-onset Alzheimer’s? How would we understand Alice’s fear and confusion when she begins to lose her memories? How would they visualize the details of her life as they flicker in and out of focus? They did it simply, eloquently—and quite literally. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Actually, &lt;em&gt;you&lt;/em&gt; did.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Fifty year-old Alice Howland is out for a run on the campus of Columbia University, where she works as a linguistics professor, when suddenly she realizes that she has no idea where she is. It comes as a frightening shock to her (but not to us, since we’re waiting for the tell-tale signs of her disease to appear). What was once familiar – buildings, the quad, a staircase – suddenly appear to her as fuzzy, abstract splotches. As the camera pans to face her, she is shown in sharp relief against her fading reality. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alzheimer’s is an ugly disease. My grandmother, who lived with us for most of my life, suffered from it. And so did we. It’s a disease that significantly affects the family. I was particularly interested in how &lt;em&gt;Still Alice&lt;/em&gt; would deal with the hopelessness of watching a once competent and highly respected woman regress to a helpless, child-like state. I was worried that using a beautiful, relatively young actress as our window into this world would diminish the disease, giving it it that Vaseline-lensed sheen that makes these types of unpleasant stories palatable to the masses. And it would have been a complete wash, if you – and we – had anyone less skilled than Julianne Moore to focus on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your relationship with actors is surprisingly intimate. In many ways, they are acting just for you. With every take you have to execute your duties flawlessly by keeping the actor perfectly in focus. The audience’s attention is automatically drawn to a sharper image, but as Alice’s focus is diminished, it’s the soft, faded edges of her world that draw us in. Julianne Moore appears in nearly every scene, and often the camera focuses on her face as she struggles to remember words or people or places. It’s a performance that works hard to defy the stereotype of the “beautiful lead with a terminal illness” trope; after all, this is an illness that we rarely see onscreen, and never before portrayed so fearlessly and without self-pity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the many things the film teaches us is that Alzheimer’s is impervious to time. So we’re not sure how long it takes for Alice to slip away from herself. But you give us some clues. Before she is diagnosed, the camera is almost always fixed on her face. As the disease takes hold and Alice must let go of the life she once had, the camera follows her – through the Columbia library, or when she goes out for a run – like a proxy for her memories, trying desperately to catch up to her, but always falling short. Seasons pass; leaves change colours and fall, leaving branches bare; Alice and her husband John embrace on a rock by the ocean, the bokeh effect around them evoking a tender melancholy; flares bounce off the snowbanks that butt up against their brownstone.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all very pretty. &lt;em&gt;Too&lt;/em&gt; pretty.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still Alice&lt;/em&gt; blurs the line between wanting to authentically portray the effects Alzheimer’s has on the patient and the family, and trying to soften the truth for those unable to handle the grim reality a disease like this presents. When it gets it right, it feels like a sharp punch to the gut. But when it errs on the side of restraint it edges dangerously into Movie of the Week territory. Thankfully, Julianne Moore’s powerful performance rescues these latter moments from their maudlin potential. Having been a renowned professor, she is invited to give a speech to an audience of Alzheimer’s patients and doctors. When the camera pans to the faces of people in the audience slow clapping with tears in their eyes, I nearly laughed at such a tired cliché. But earlier, when Alice laments that she wishes she had cancer because at least she wouldn’t feel so ashamed, I cried, because, having dealt with both diseases, I know how painfully true that statement is. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alice’s situation – surrounded by a loving family, in a gorgeous New York brownstone and ocean-side summer home, nary a medical bill in sight – is not representative of the reality for most Alzheimer’s patients. But the conflict between Alice and her youngest daughter Lydia is familiar to anyone who has struggled with parental disapproval, and is refreshingly sugar-free. Kristen Stewart’s trademark mumbling is welcome here as Lydia and Alice are faced with an abrupt reversal of roles. This is when the film shifts from being a story about Alice to one about the people she is leaving behind. The difficult choices and daily frustrations an Alzheimer’s family faces is worthy of its own film, and though it takes up minimal space here, it is handled deftly and with dignity. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Still Alice&lt;/em&gt;, takes an uncomfortable topic and wraps it in an easy-to-swallow format; a beautiful woman, pretty surroundings, and a happy-ish ending. Unlike the far superior 2012 Cannes Palme D’or Winner &lt;em&gt;Amour&lt;/em&gt;, which tackles similar subject matter but without the soft-focus pretense, &lt;em&gt;Still Alice&lt;/em&gt; aims for mass appeal. As a family member of an Alzheimer’s patient, I realize the importance of awareness, so I don’t necessarily think mass appeal is such a bad thing. And yet, as heartbreakingly amazing as Julianne Moore is in this film (as evidenced by her shiny, new Oscar), her performance still pales in comparison to the gutting brilliance of &lt;em&gt;Amour&lt;/em&gt;’s Emmanuelle Riva (who lost the Best Actress Oscar to Jennifer Lawrence a few years ago). But I guess Julianne Moore wasting away before our eyes gets more butts in seats than an old, naked, scared French lady played by an actress no one has heard of. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s all about perspective, and no one knows that better than you do.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Timbuktu</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I will admit I knew next to nothing about Timbuktu prior to seeing Abderrahmane Sissako’s film. For me, it was just the place the evil butler tried to send the kittens in &lt;em&gt;The Aristocats&lt;/em&gt;. I certainly had no idea about its past as a hub of Islamic language and culture. I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; remember when it was briefly taken over by the Maghreb arm of al Qaeda, which brings us to the events depicted in the film. All I knew going in was that it was about a town that gets taken over by jihadist militants. I was expecting it to be brutal and depressing. What I saw instead was a beautifully crafted portrayal of life under extremist control. I knew a bit about the Big News Story of occupation and liberation, but the film gave me a closer look at the smaller picture (which I think might be the more important one), and the ways in which people confront the loss of the smallest freedoms.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The central plot follows Kidane, a guitar-strumming cattle herder and his family who live peacefully in the desert, beyond the reach of the militants. Of course, they don’t &lt;em&gt;stay&lt;/em&gt; beyond that reach for very long. While Kidane and his family are the heart of the narrative, the rest of the characters are every bit as compelling, even those who are only in one or two scenes. Though we don’t see more than a couple of brief moments in their lives, they stayed with me long after the film ended. Your long takes and frequent use of close-ups afforded the actors near-total command of my attention, from the girl glaring in sullen defiance at members of a Sharia tribunal, to the misery and regret on the face of a young jihadist as he briefly recalls his former life as an aspiring rapper. I say &lt;em&gt;near&lt;/em&gt;-total command of my attention because I can’t ignore the profound impact the film’s other visual and stylistic elements had on me. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is a film about people rebelling at every opportunity, from the subtlest of expressions to outright defiance, against the constraints forced upon them. I feel like you were in lock step with these many tiny rebellions. The militants in the film spend a lot of time droning on and on about everything that is forbidden, and it’s a long bloody list. But for every forbidden pleasure, we see a character indulging in it. And you aid and abet the townsfolk by infusing each shot with colour and beauty. No bright clothing allowed? Boom - voodoo priestess parading through town in vivid blues and reds with a pet chicken and zero fucks given. Football is forbidden? Cut to kids joyfully kicking an imaginary ball around. No music allowed? Secret midnight jam session captured with a sense of intimacy and romance that would most certainly not fly with the ‘Chef Djihadiste’. Not everyone gets away with their acts of defiance, and here we see the kind of cruelty of which the jihadists are capable. Mercifully, you don’t dwell on these images. We all know how brutal their ‘justice’ is. We don’t need to see it play out in any detail. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film uses a gentle yet unyielding touch in underscoring the absurdity of the jihadists’ attitudes and actions. That it also uses humour to this end was surprising, and one of the things that makes &lt;em&gt;Timbuktu&lt;/em&gt; unique. There are moments of flat-out mocking - I noticed you frequently had a donkey wander in and out of the shot whenever the jihadists approached. Well played. But there are also moments of softer derision that treat their targets with grace and empathy. ‘Jihadist doing tai chi in a trance’ isn’t something I ever thought I would see, and it makes no sense at all. It’s ridiculous and we all have a good laugh at his expense because (in the words of my companion),“fuck that guy”, but it is also one of the most serene and beautiful moments in the entire film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The end of the film isn’t all that optimistic. French and Malian forces would drive the jihadists out within a year, but I couldn’t help thinking about all the other places and people who continue to struggle under the control of Islamist extremists. You could have easily clubbed us over the head with the mindless cruelty and destruction wrought by such groups but I, for one, am glad you chose to go with a hopeful reminder that while extremist ideology may exert control over one’s body, the spirit puts up one hell of a fight. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Two Days, One Night</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;“Too slow” is a complaint I often overhear when leaving a theatre after a film. “Nothing really &lt;em&gt;happens&lt;/em&gt;” is another. I heard both immediately after seeing Jean Pierre and Luc Dardenne’s &lt;em&gt;Two Days, One Night&lt;/em&gt;. I didn’t say anything, but had I chosen to stop and drop some film geek wisdom on that total stranger, I would have pushed my glasses up the bridge of my nose and informed him that the film’s slow pace and deceptively simple plot actually complement an ambivalent, complicated narrative that unfolds far quicker than they realized. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One Friday evening, factory worker Sandra is informed that she is to be laid off. Her boss grants her one last chance to save her job; She is given the weekend to convince her colleagues to vote for her to remain at the factory, the catch being that in doing so they must forego their own bonuses. Faced with her family’s financial ruin and battling her clinical depression with some highly inadvisable over-medicating, Sandra spends her weekend calling on each of her co-workers, pleading for their support.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Even if viewed as a simple character study, the film is well worth the price of admission. Marion Cotillard makes it impossible to take your eyes off Sandra, even when you feel compelled to look away, as though that would somehow spare her the slightest amount of shame and humiliation. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, as I said before, there is so much more going on. You set a pace that matches Sandra’s demeanor at the outset of the film: somnambulistic and hesitant. However, it allows us to really feel Sandra’s desperation build. Given the episodic feel to Sandra’s encounters with her co-workers, a more rapid or frenetic pacing would have made the plot feel repetitive quite quickly. Instead, there is a cushion of time in between plot points that allow the viewer to contemplate the film’s bigger questions and issues; Between Sandra and her colleagues, some in even more dire circumstances than hers, who is more deserving? What is the likelihood that Sandra keeping her job will mean someone else losing theirs? What kind of shitty boss pits his staff against each other like that?! How would &lt;em&gt;I&lt;/em&gt; vote? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Given the heavy political concerns raised by the film, I wouldn’t have been surprised if you had gone for a more hard-hitting, crowd-stirring approach in the editing room. But this is a Dardenne Brothers film, not &lt;em&gt;Les Miserables&lt;/em&gt;. Come Monday morning, Sandra will either get to keep her job—by now a hollow victory—or be turned out by her peers. She will not find her inner Norma Rae, and there will be no “I am Spartacus” moment right before the vote. Instead, you allow the highs and lows of the plot to gently flow into an elegant and poignant conclusion, as though you shared my need to see Sandra retain or regain at least a modicum of dignity.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Kingsmen: The Secret Service</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;You have achieved an unenviable immortality since your ignominious passing., haven’t you? The last thing I was expecting when I walked into the theatre to watch Matthew Vaughn’s &lt;em&gt;Kingsman: The Secret Service&lt;/em&gt; was a vicious skewering of your Ubermensch John Galt. But given how much philosophical cover you have afforded the latest iteration of morally challenged free marketers I suppose I shouldn’t be entirely surprised.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Because there it was, that skewering splattered across the screen—from the remote island filled with the elite movers and shakers to the class-consciousness that fills almost every frame of this movie. &lt;em&gt;Kingsman: The Secret Service&lt;/em&gt; is informed by every James Bond joint that Roger Moore ever made —coupled with a Picketty-like critique and the idea that a Gentleman (or Gentlewoman) is made, not born.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was all there, plus some of the old Ultraviolence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Samuel L. Jackson might seem to be an odd avatar for &lt;a href=&quot;about:blank&quot;&gt;John Galt&lt;/a&gt;, with his lisp and Flavor Flav fashion sense, but in all ways that matter he is a note perfect melding of a James Bond megalomaniac and the fatuous ideal of your Objectivist ethos.  Both are equally cartoonish, in their conception and motivations, and the combination works remarkably well within the confines of Vaughn’s surreal, amped up world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vaughn himself seems particularly scattershot with his chosen targets. It is a laundry list of the unpleasant and woefully mislead. Religious fundamentalists, the lads down the pub, Old Money types and Venture Capitalists as well as brutal climbers like Michael Caine, who is so eager to eradicate any trace of his humble beginnings that he gleefully subverts his life’s work to maintain the Kingsman’s class driven purity.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is also some confusion about what exactly is appropriate as an object of aspiration. Is it excellence? Power? Sexual Conquest? Saville Row smoothness? All of the above? But it is a glorious kind of manic confusion and Vaughn and the remarkably strong cast make it work eighty-five percent of the time. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Colin Firth was a happy surprise, a kind of Henry Higgins with a bulletproof umbrella and a remarkable facility for all sorts of ruckus. The set piece that features him annihilating an entire Jesus Camp-type Congregation was a personal favorite. Vaughn does Guy Ritchie slow motion progressions far better than Guy Ritchie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One of the truly retrograde artifacts of &lt;em&gt;Kingsman: The Secret Service&lt;/em&gt; is its sexual politics. Women are either the competent and emasculating nemesis, vague paragons of virtue or simply a sexual reward. Here Vaughn seems stuck in the Old Bond trope most purely. This is a film about men and their various ticks and affectations. And in the same way that the Moore Bond films were Walter Mitty-level fantasies about urbane, smoove talking killers this film seems entirely comfortable inhabiting the same conceit. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The film sits squarely on the shoulders of its young protagonist, played with a remarkable depth and confidence by Taron Egerton. Eggsy is a lad from a Council Estate (the British equivalent of inner city projects) the kind of Public Housing that your adherents see as ground zero for all the ills of socialist parasitism. That he is the eventual architect of the demise of the Galt-clone is both pointed and surprisingly satisfying. I usually don’t care for these kind of simplistic revenge fantasies but Vaughn managed to target most of my personal peeves so well, and with a kind of nasty wit, that I enjoyed this movie thoroughly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I suppose in a lot of ways this is the perfect film to put the final nail in your coffin. A chimera that meanders all over the map with a kind of pyrotechnic competence anchored by the inimitable Mark Strong: a working class Scotsman who, in the end, sides with the slightly anarchic kids as they summarily execute the 1% that you fetishized so slavishly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here is to ludicrous and enjoyable confections that put you in your place, Ayn.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>5 Radical Ways to Rejuvenate the Oscars</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Academy,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Look, I know the Academy Awards are not a public institution, bound by oversight committees, regulatory reforms, and never-ending calls to accountability. But they might as well be.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I haven’t missed an Oscar telecast since I was 10 years old – back when I insisted Spielberg &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to “finally win for &lt;em&gt;Schindler’s List&lt;/em&gt;, dammit” (so what if I hadn’t seen the film?). Like millions of people, that unreasonable sense of ownership, outrage and interest has never changed. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Nor, I think, would you want it to. That we the people care enough to complain is a testament to your cultural relevance (and, by extension, economic well-being). The Grammy’s only &lt;em&gt;wish&lt;/em&gt;people were passionate enough to nitpick changes to Album/Record/Song of the Year awards. So please, read on with an open mind. No one is asking you to throw out the&lt;em&gt;Million Dollar Baby&lt;/em&gt; with the bath water, but here’s a few ways you can stay on top:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1. Eliminate Male/Female Actor Distinctions&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The idea:&lt;/strong&gt; This is a biggie, and it would be revolutionary. But it shouldn’t be. Like all affirmative actions, the idea of having male and female actors compete for different awards is rooted in good intentions. It’s also a sign of progress when their time has passed. Yes, women’s roles have historically been paltry compared to their male counterparts. Actually, you can (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.indiewire.com/article/sorry-ladies-study-on-women-in-film-and-television-confirms-the-worst-20150210?utm_campaign=sorry-ladies-study-on-women-in-film-and-television-confirms-the-worst-20150210&amp;amp;utm_medium=social&amp;amp;utm_source=Facebook&amp;amp;utm_content=sorry-ladies-study-on-women-in-film-and-television-confirms-the-worst-20150210&quot;&gt;quite easily&lt;/a&gt;) argue that not much has changed – except each year when ten famous actresses and supporting actresses get to pretend like all is well in the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The result:&lt;/strong&gt; A single Best Actor (Male or Female) award would change the conversation about how women are portrayed in films. We could finally compare characters to characters, instead of pretending that acting is like a sport where men have some sort of physiological advantage. To ease the transition, I would earmark three nomination slots for men and three for women – but only have one winner. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Go ahead. Imagine it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The counter-argument&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“Men and women don’t compete for the same roles! It doesn’t make sense!”&lt;/em&gt;  Really? Tell that to Tilda Swinton (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/7/3/snowpiercer.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Snowpiercer&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), Angela Bassett (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/3/22/olympus-has-fallen.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Olympus Has Fallen&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), Angelina Jolie (&lt;a href=&quot;http://articles.latimes.com/2010/jul/22/entertainment/la-et-salt-20100722&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Salt&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;), or any number of other actresses who have had to win roles away from men. Moreover, do you think Tom Hanks could have auditioned for &lt;em&gt;Ray&lt;/em&gt;, or Jamie Foxx was considered for &lt;em&gt;Forrest Gump&lt;/em&gt;? Malarkey! We don’t divide awards by race, and we shouldn’t by sex. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Acting is acting, period. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;2. Divide Fictional/Biographical Acting Awards&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The idea:&lt;/strong&gt; Remember back when I said acting is acting, period? Yeah, about that... You Academy voters have an unnatural obsession with rewarding actors who portray real-life people. To wit: 7 of the past 10 male actor winners and 8 of the past 15 female actor winners have played characters based on real people. This year alone, 4 of the 5 Best (Male) Actor nominations are for biographical roles. It’s getting a bit silly. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The result:&lt;/strong&gt;If nothing else, having separate character categories would keep the acting races more interesting. But it would also draw more attention to the craft of communicating human emotion rather than mimicking mannerisms. Of course that’s reductionist and not always the case. There’s a lot to be said for evoking the spirit of a real noteworthy individual – even ones who aren’t well-known to the public (like Ron Woodroof from &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/9/19/dallas-buyers-club.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dallas Buyers Club&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;). But it should be a separate category. For your sake, if not ours. Bonus: it would also fill the two empty categories (main and supporting) you’ll have when you eliminate the male/female acting distinction. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The counter-argument&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“Just because a character is based on a real-life person doesn’t change the actor’s craft. And where do you draw the line with ancient historical figures?”&lt;/em&gt; Great question! As you know, it’s one that the Writer’s branch of the Academy has been dealing with forever. And that’s your answer: if writing has to be divided into “original” and “adapted” screenplays for having even a whiff of source material origins, then the same staunch logic should apply to actors.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3. Create an Award for Best Stunts&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The idea&lt;/strong&gt;: Big budget, tent-pole films are the only thing holding Hollywood studios together. Scale of spectacle is often what justifies the theatrical experience, so it’s high time that one of the last unheralded departments of the industry – the one that often shines in these types of films – finally gets their turn in the spotlight. They’re literally putting their lives on the line to provide people a fleeting moment of entertainment. I think they’ve earned it. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The result&lt;/strong&gt;: Everyone has, at one point, complained about digital effects “looking fake”, which too often diminishes the emotional stakes on screen. However, people can’t get enough of the thrilling skyscraper sequences from movies like &lt;em&gt;Mission Impossible: Ghost Protocol&lt;/em&gt;, or the gritty realism of fight scenes in movies like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/4/10/the-raid-2-berendal.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Raid 2&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Great stunts are still being performed, but they’re too often eclipsed by a digital revolution that takes away as much credit as it absorbs blame. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The counter-argument&lt;/strong&gt;: “&lt;em&gt;There’s not enough industry support for a Best Stunts category. It was voted down just&lt;/em&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/race/academy-votes-creating-oscar-category-202123&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;back in 2011&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;&lt;em&gt;.”&lt;/em&gt; Like outlier sports that have to earn their way into the Olympics, it’s normal for old establishments to resist change. Heck, it wasn’t until 1981 that you guys even had an &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/12/12/the-make-up-of-2012-pt-1.html&quot;&gt;award for Best Make-Up&lt;/a&gt;. But it’s not too late to right an old wrong – and, at the same time, get people more excited about the art of filmmaking. That’s the point of this whole thing, isn’t it? &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;4. Turn the Best Foreign Language Film Category into a World Cup-style tournament&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The idea:&lt;/strong&gt; This category should be a major prize, and not a clandestine sideshow. Currently, each country (via a closed committee) submits one film for consideration. Then, all the submissions (around 80) are cut down to a shortlist of nine, before five nominees are selected. That secondary step of selecting nominees from a shortlist was recently revamped, but only at a procedural level.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there’s a way to get people around the world much more involved, right from the start: borrow the format of the World Cup. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The result:&lt;/strong&gt; Dividing countries into pools who compete against one-another to advance to the next round would not only bring awareness to a greater number of films, but get the public watching more foreign content. The pools would be statistically weighted (based on previous award wins and whatever else), but a film would need to pass three or four rounds before being a nominee. The decision would still rest in the hands of the Academy, but the public could be along for the ride, and hopefully have access to screenings as the process happens, just like a sporting event.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The counter-argument&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“No way, it will only draw attention to an already contentious process – not to mention the difficulty of arranging distribution rights for all the films around the world”&lt;/em&gt;. Oh, stop it with your facts and reality. Think big: a public tournament format of narrowing down the films would go a long way for gaining exposure and interest in this award, and all the associated films (not just the winner). Sure it’s more work, but also more reward. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;strong&gt;Remodel Academy Membership&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The idea:&lt;/strong&gt; People have complained about your “steak eater” membership for years, and this year’s #OscarsSoWhite campaign drew enormous attention to the lack of diversity in your ranks. So how do you address this issue, without advocating tokenism or lowering the bar to membership? I can’t believe I’m saying this, but you might have to take a page from the Canadian Senate, or UN Security Council: setting term limits on appointed members and/or rotating voting powers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The result:&lt;/strong&gt; It takes many people the better part of their career to be invited into the Academy, so it’s hard to begrudge its older skewing demographics. Yet begrudge we do, and this membership remodelling won’t just transform your statistics, but get you in touch with a younger audience (ie. increase TV ratings). Rather than the current opt-out policy, capping term limits and/or rotating voting years would ensure a diversity of worthy voices get a chance. Moreover, you could have an established number of permanent members in each branch (like the Security Council), but by allocating a fixed number of permanent spots, you could avoid the full-on death watch for new spots to open up in the current membership-for-life model.    &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The counter-argument&lt;/strong&gt;: &lt;em&gt;“People work hard to join the Academy – it’s unfair to take that away.”&lt;/em&gt; The new focus should aim to recruit the best members in the industry, not just lifetime achievers or friends of insiders.  Fixed terms would mean people have to stay working hard to keep membership, and as a result, have one more motivation to create more great films. Change like this would add legitimacy to the Academy, not take it away. Plus, it’s not like fewer stars would show up to the Oscars – you’ve been to the Golden Globes, right? Only 90 foreign journalists vote for those, and it’s the second biggest award show in town. Your membership credibility isn’t going anywhere.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Fifty Shades of Grey</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I mean, really. Why even bother showing up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was no doubt  exciting when the &lt;em&gt;Fifty Shades of Grey&lt;/em&gt; filmmakers first chose you as they’re own Christian Grey – a confident, experienced man to guide them through the pain-for-pleasure world of BDSM. You probably stroked your whip, fondled your chains, and tugged your rope in anticipation. Oh, the things you were going to show them. But how soon did you realize that Hollywood is even more of a cold-clam than Anastasia Steele?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe they lead you on for a while. Even I felt slightly seduced (or at least amused) by the film initially. There was a playfulness to director Sam Taylor-Johnson’s touch – a warmth and self-awareness that forgave the cloud of naïveté wavering overhead. After all, audiences aren’t used to erotic thrillers. We know every beat of action movies and romantic comedies, but this was supposed to be different. More adult – sophisticated. As such, my wife and I guided each other through the complex and prolonged foreplay sequences:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The grey pencil in her mouth represents his PENIS!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;“The rain represents how WET he makes her! Pathetic phallic-cy!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, making these remarks in a theatre would get us punished. But the long pauses between lines of dialogue almost invited midnight movie-ish call-outs. And we weren’t alone. Our advance screening was packed with over 300 women (and 27 men, the security guard told me) buzzing before and during the film. The teenage lip-bitters to our left and fifty shades of grey hairs in front of us were all working through a serious case of the vapors. It almost felt warranted for a while, as the film gently asserts itself with blunt talk and tours of Christian’s playroom (which ultimately feels more like a museum). But it loses any momentum or sense of danger once it finally indulges in the carefully framed, dimly lit, slow-moving sex scenes – showing just enough ass, tits, and pubic hair to feel risqué. You might have been a great help to the props department, but how emasculating it must have felt to never flex your flogging muscles. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Aside from the 27-year-old billionaire fantasy, however, this is actually a more reasoned first reaction to the leather lifestyle. Dakota Johnson nails the neophyte virginal aura, even if she eventually overdoes her elementary tells. Jamie Dornan also strikes a good balance between mysterious and miserable. The film ironically climaxes during the contract negotiation scene, where they at least &lt;em&gt;talk&lt;/em&gt; about NSFW butt plugs, genital clamps, and fisting (both vaginal and anal). This clinical consent sequence (which is the entire storyline, actually) is all done with tongue-in-whatever-cheek so pretty much anyone will feel miles away from needing a safe word. As a beginner’s guide to bondage, I can see the appeal.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that ending. A quick scan of the synopsis online tells me the script stays pretty true to E.L. James’ pop-erotica phenomenon (which I also learned, hilariously started as &lt;em&gt;Twilight&lt;/em&gt; fan fiction between Edward and Bella). But it feels like an outright condemnation of you and the people who do BDSM. It’s far from my bag, but I can’t see you getting new business after this. Rather than an exciting foray into the world of gag balls and suspension, it’s a light romp with feathers, blindfolds, and harmless spanking – right up until it goes to an only slightly darker shade of grey, and becomes outraged by the whole thing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s, as Christian says, what&amp;#39;s fifty shades of fucked up.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Last Days in Vietnam</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Your job involved a very particular type of extraction. You were tasked to find filmed evidence to back up the stories told by people who lived through the harrowing final days before Saigon fell to the North Vietnamese. Some of this footage you sourced from authorities like the Big Three television networks, the National Archives and Associated Press, and some was supplied by the very people involved. Regardless of origin, it must have been difficult to make decisions about which footage stayed in the picture and which didn’t. No doubt there were many ways this story could have been told. In the end, you have to stand by the choices made by the filmmakers and hope that they’re the right ones.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Last Days&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Vietnam&lt;/em&gt; chronicles the final weeks of the American involvement in the Vietnam War, and the chaotic, zero-hour evacuation of U.S. and South Vietnamese citizens from Saigon. It is told from the perspective of the people who were there, mainly the U.S. servicemen, CIA analysts, and pilots. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Like me, you must have inwardly rejoiced when you realized filmmaker Rory Kennedy wasn’t interested in investing any time in the Vietnam War’s exhausting origin story. What she wanted from you was right there in the title. With the exception of a few iconic images (helicopters being pushed off an aircraft carrier, desperate evacuees climbing a rickety ladder on what we learn was &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; the roof of the American embassy), most of the visuals you supply feel remarkably fresh. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unfortunately, Kennedy’s pedestrian footage/talking head formula does not. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s not to say that the personal accounts described and depicted here aren’t thrilling in their own right. Most of the servicemen involved in helping people escape were acting against direct orders from American Ambassador Graham Martin, who refused to evacuate until Saigon was literally surrounded by the North Vietnamese Army. Your footage supports the servicemen’s play-by-play of how the situation worsened as the diplomatic foot-dragging forced those trapped to resort to the most desperate of measures.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We see incredible scenes of heroism: people racing down a runway after a commercial airliner while the flight crew frantically pulls as many aboard as they can; a South Vietnamese Chinook pilot hovering beside the USS Kirk after dropping off a load of evacuees, then abandoning his aircraft and swimming aboard the carrier. We hear Marines tell us how they were breaking rules, but that they had to do what they felt was right. When you see the tear-streaked, terrified faces waiting inside the cramped American embassy, it’s difficult to disagree with that sentiment. But like the almost forty-year-old footage you relied on, Kennedy’s focus seems a little faded and fuzzy around the edges. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some bewildering omissions. Why no interviews with insiders who might have shed light on Ambassador Graham’s reluctance to evacuate? Or with any of the thousands of Vietnamese women married to U.S. servicemen who spent days waiting with their children inside the embassy, hoping for a ride out? Or what about actually &lt;em&gt;going&lt;/em&gt; to Vietnam to talk to those who didn’t make it out? Instead, Kennedy limits &lt;em&gt;Last Days in Vietnam&lt;/em&gt; to a largely white, male, American perspective (forgive me if I have a hard time believing Henry Kissinger, an unreliable narrator if there ever was one, when he says that the number one concern of the White House was saving as many lives as possible). Kennedy’s take on this dark and convoluted quagmire finds its balance somewhere between oblique reportage and post-hoc apologia. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be fair, this documentary is part of the PBS series &lt;em&gt;American Experience&lt;/em&gt;, which explicitly states right in the title who the intended audience is. Maybe &lt;em&gt;America’s Last Days&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;In&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;Vietnam&lt;/em&gt; would have been a more apt description of the film. I find it interesting that Clint Eastwood has been taking flack for playing &lt;a href=&quot;http://theantimedia.org/the-real-american-sniper/&quot;&gt;fast and loose with the facts&lt;/a&gt; in &lt;em&gt;American Sniper,&lt;/em&gt; but Kennedy’s skewed (and partially taxpayer funded) interpretation of the end of the Vietnam War gets a pass. But hey, jingoism is as jingoism does! Looking forward to twenty-some years from now when PBS can tell me how the Iraq war ended.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Wading through those miles of celluloid must have given you a perspective on just how heart-breaking the situation was for both Americans and South Vietnamese trying to escape an escalating humanitarian tragedy. The U.S. involvement in the Vietnam War is largely remembered as a disaster, and despite some genuine heroics, the ending was just as bungled and mismanaged as the beginning and the middle. It’s obvious that you and the filmmakers sincerely wanted to honour those who worked in vain to save as many lives as they could. But Kennedy feels too intent on trying to save America’s legacy along with it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The footage you found was truly exceptional, it’s a shame it was used for a propaganda film.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Ida</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I’m crushing a bit here.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There is hubris, and then there is having an entire film hinge on the performance of a complete neophyte—an apparently reluctant &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.scpr.org/programs/the-frame/2015/02/03/41386/oscars-2015-ida-filmmaker-auditioned-400-actresses/&quot;&gt;one&lt;/a&gt; at that. But there you are, the title character present in almost every frame of Pawel Pawlikowski’s &lt;em&gt;Ida&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Set in the Stalinist Poland of 1961, &lt;em&gt;Ida&lt;/em&gt; is the story of a young nun who is coerced by her Mother Superior into confronting her family’s complicated past. Rigorously composed and shot in black and white, the film is somehow also starkly intimate. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ida&lt;/em&gt; is a beautiful film, with angular compositions and unconventional framing that manages to be both unsettling and serene. Much of the first act, which is spent in and around the austere silence of the convent, is largely occupied with architectural spaces and exquisitely lit compositions. Humans are often small, almost insignificant elements, sometimes given just the lower third of the frame to occupy. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This is perhaps the most jarringly exquisite film I have ever seen. The complexity and power of each image tends to feel overwhelming initially. It is like viewing an endless series of beautifully composed photos and it threatens to overshadow the rather slender narrative. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What prevents the film from being buried by the stark power of its own images and transforms it into a story that is compelling, as well as tragic, is your interaction with the last surviving member of your long lost family—your aunt. She is a character, in the absolute best sense of that word, played ferociously by Agata Kulesza. A ruthless Communist apparatchik of unquestioned vigor as well as a hard-drinking atheist possessed of none of the restraint that seems to exude from you like a subtle perfume, she is also your guide into the labyrinth that is your family history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the second act, &lt;em&gt;Ida&lt;/em&gt; becomes this poignant, and sometimes bleakly funny, road movie.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still perfectly composed and allowing for each moment to play out with remarkable patience, it transforms into a gritty, neo-realist trip into rural, post-war Poland. Both women have a particular gravitational pull that affects each other as well as those around them.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kulesza gives an extraordinary performance—at turns bombastic and then almost witheringly despondent—but it is counterbalanced by your intuitive stillness and precocious dignity. These are two of the most arresting characters I have experienced this last year and despite the short run time (80 minutes), I feel like I know something important about each of these women by the end of the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While &lt;em&gt;Ida&lt;/em&gt; evokes comparison to other works (Dreyer’s &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d3Q6FVhqLY0&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Passion of Joan of Arc&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; as just one example), it is entirely its own thing, and that is partially owing to your performance. You are both enigmatic and completely transparent, and every moment the camera spends on you, it is still never enough. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Ida&lt;/em&gt; is also another example of the quiet renaissance that we are almost surreptitiously experiencing these days. Perhaps somewhat hidden by the shadow of the summer tent poles and the cries of doom and gloom, diverse filmmakers like &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/1/20/a-most-violent-year.html&quot;&gt;JC Chandor&lt;/a&gt; and Pawlikowski, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/10/29/nightcrawler.html&quot;&gt;Dan Gilroy&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Drop&amp;#39;s&lt;/em&gt; Michael R. Roskam are all creating superb, mid-budget films that are head and shoulders above most of the dreck of the last fifteen or twenty years. &lt;em&gt;Ida&lt;/em&gt; is an entirely uncontroversial nominee for an Academy Award, and these days that is saying something indeed.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Finally, it seems like Pawlikowski was indeed correct when he insisted on your participation. &lt;/p&gt;
