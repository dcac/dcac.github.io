  				<p>Dear Crime Fans, <br />
  				<p>It may not have the same rabid following as Horror, Sci-Fi and Animation, but the crime genre does have one thing going for it - some of the best movies ever made. </p>

<p>In doing this <strong>Greatest Movies A-Z</strong> series with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg">WatchMojo</a>, it would have been a crime to skip the genre responsible for so much incredible and important cinema. Some movies ended up getting whacked we would have never expected, but you can’t go against the family - or the rules of the alphabet. Enjoy. </p>

<p>Again, we gave ourselves some guidelines:</p>

<ol>
<li>One film per letter</li>
<li>Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)</li>
<li>Final list should encapsulate the genre</li>
</ol>

<p>The last rule dictated a lot of our hardest decisions. We also, as always, strived for balance when it came down to a pissing contest over what film was the “best”.</p>

<p>So here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission. </p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-crime/top-decade.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>TOP DECADE: 1990s</strong><br />
        Your gut probably tells you it will be the 70s. Based on this list, it’s almost the 50s. But in the end the 90s proved the most prolific decade for greatest crime movies. And it’s not like they claimed easy letters. We dare you to disagree with any of those 90s spots.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-crime/hardest-letter.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>HARDEST LETTER: T</strong><br />
          <em>Taxi Driver</em> is not on this list. Neither is <em>Touch of Evil</em>. Nor <em>Traffic.</em> Scorsese got M instead (taking it away from <em>The Maltese Falcon</em>, <em>Memento,</em> and even Fritz Lang’s <em>M</em>) since he really couldn’t expect to take G - even if <em>Goodfellas</em> is hellagood. It’s a deal with the devil, but we played by eye-for-an-eye rules (or, in this case, T-for-a-G)
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-crime/cheated-out.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>The Departed</em></strong><br />
        We went with <em>Infernal Affairs</em>, the Hong Kong movie it’s based on, instead. Yes it helped us make the list less American-centric, but it’s also pretty defensible if you’ve seen that original trilogy. We kind of double-screwed Scorsese though, since it meant we also didn’t give him <em>The Irishman</em>. That’s the real I-for-an-I!
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-crime/best-battle.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>The Night Hunter</em> vs <em>No Country for Old Men</em></strong><br />
        Just brutal, we know. We might as well have flipped a coin. But Anton Chigurh bit the dust. What’s the most you ever lost on a coin toss?
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin:4rem 0;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-crime/special-consideration.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>Uncut Gems</em></strong><br />
         We were thrilled that <em>Queen and Slim</em> not only gave us a 2019 movie, but a good one. U was not as straightforward. The 90s were already very well represented, but we easily could have gone with <em>The Usual Suspects</em>. Or even <em>The Untouchables</em>. But in the end, we went with the greatest trick Adam Sandler ever pulled - convincing us he deserves to exist (as a serious actor).
    </p>

<p>Think your list would be better? More balanced? Less heart-breaking? Let us know.</p>

				<title> Feature: War Movies: A-Z</title>
				<description>
  				<![CDATA[

  				<p>Dear War Fans, <br />
  				<p>No one is really a fan of war itself, but films <em>about</em> war? That&#39;s another story.</p>

<p>This is the second video in our <strong>Greatest Movies A-Z</strong> series with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg">WatchMojo</a>, and it opens with a bang. Many of the other films are less obvious, but equally glorious (and/or horrifying), so strap in.</p>

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="624" height="351" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B5XQYYw-44w?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>Again, we gave ourselves some guidelines:</p>

<ol>
<li>One film per letter</li>
<li>Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)</li>
<li>Final list should encapsulate the genre</li>
</ol>

<p>The last rule dictated a lot of our hardest decisions. It also made for some heated debates, which only barely avoided becoming all-out fights. </p>

<p>(Don’t worry. Cooler heads prevailed. Even if that goes against the spirit of the genre.)</p>

<p>So here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission.</p>

<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM WAR A-Z</p>

<p>Now that this first video is out, here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission. </p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-war/top-decade.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>TOP DECADE: 1960s</strong><br />
        Objectively, the 1960s just have the most films on our list (even if <em>X-15</em> is more about test pilots and the space race than actual war). But most of the others are iconic and run the full spectrum of the war genre, from terrifying, to rousing, to epics, to even a musical. The decade redefined the genre. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-war/hardest-letter.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>HARDEST LETTER: B</strong><br />
        Depending on your age, the first “B” movie you probably think of in the war genre is <em>The</em> <em>Bridge on the River Kwai</em> or <em>Black Hawk Down</em>. Or you could definitely argue for <em>Braveheart</em> (we stuck to modern war, even if we didn’t state that as a rule). They’re all A+ movies (not B-movies!) for different reasons. But <em>The Battle of Algiers</em> is still one of the most impressive films ever made. The White House actually screened it for Generals before invading Iraq to help them understand modern warfare. If you haven’t seen it, go watch it. Now!<br />
        <br />
        (Also, P and D were bloodbaths to argue between in their own right)
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-war/cheated-out.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>Valkyrie</em></strong><br />
        It probably should be on the list. It’s definitely more classically a “war” movie than <em>Victory</em>. The only reason it isn’t here, honestly, is because we used it on our very first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6vHljlgQsU"><em>Action Movies A-Z</em></a> before we changed the format of the videos. We didn’t want to repeat ourselves. But if this new series goes well, we'll probably redo Action anyway, and then really seem like fools. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-war/best-battle.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>The Great Escape</em> <strong>vs</strong> <em>Grand Illusion</em></strong><br />
        This one hurt. <em>Grand Illusion</em> was the first-ever release of the Criterion Collection. It’s a renowned piece of humanist anti-war filmmaking, which continues to age incredibly well. But it’s not Steve McQueen on a motorbike, and our dads would never speak to us again if it wasn’t included.  
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin:4rem 0;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-war/special-consideration.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>Come and See</em></strong><br />
         It’s here because it’s devastating and underseen. Know what’s <em>not</em> underseen or on this list? <em>Casablanca</em>. Plenty of people will call it a war film, but come on. That’s not the shelf you’re going to find <em>Casablanca</em> on at the video store. You still go to the video store, right?
    </p>

				<title> Feature: Animated Movies: A-Z</title>
				<description>
  				<![CDATA[
  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/a-z-animation.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear Animation Fans, <br />
  				<p>Who knew debates over the best animated films of all-time would get so…. animated?</p>

<p>As we continue our <strong>Greatest Movies A-Z</strong> series with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg">WatchMojo</a>, we made sure to draw from a long history of classic animation feature films. EWven though for this first season we are focusing on genres, and animation is a medium, it’s a category we just couldn’t ignore. Enjoy. </p>

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="624" height="351" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPBwj6mD-Qg?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>Again, we gave ourselves some guidelines:</p>

<ol>
<li>One film per letter</li>
<li>Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)</li>
<li>Final list should encapsulate the genre</li>
</ol>

<p>The last rule dictated a lot of our hardest decisions. We also had to ignore certain “outdated cultural stereotypes” at times to focus instead on the larger cultural impact. </p>

<p>So here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission. </p>

<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM ANIMATION A-Z</p>

<p>Now that this first video is out, here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission. </p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-animation/top-decade.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>TOP DECADE: 00s</strong><br />
        It makes sense that the decade which saw the introduction of an Oscar category for Best Animated Feature is when the medium really started to flourish. Pixar changed the game, taking the shine off Disney’s new golden era (until Disney gobbled Pixar up, too), while Anime surged in popularity. DOn’t sleep on the 90sl of course. And ‘88 alone gave us three Toho masterpieces - how does that happen??
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-animation/hardest-letter.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>HARDEST LETTER: S</strong><br />
        The default here would have been to go with the O.G. Disney classic <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em>. Recency bias would put <em>Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse</em> ahead of the pack. And nostalgia could have carried <em>Shrek</em> right to the top. Hell, even <em>South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut</em> would compete in almost any other letter. Instead, we had to go with what many consider Hayao Miyazaki’s masterpiece, <em>Spirited Away</em>.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-animation/cheated-out.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>Fantastic Mr. Fox</em></strong><br />
        They probably won’t be the most vocal corner of the Internet, but it’s impossible to deny the _Frozen-_heads and what that film did for Disney’s 20-year drought of creating a true animated classic. Sorry, Wes.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-animation/best-battle.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>Toy Story</em> <strong>vs</strong> <em>Toy Story 3</em></strong><br />
        If you accept that one of the Toy Story movies has to make the list (and yes, accept it!), then it really comes down to which one. You could easily argue any of the four films, but <em>Toy Story 3</em> has the most convincing track-record to compete (between box-office, Oscar nominations, and general love). Still, we went with the original. Not only is it a great film, but it made computer animation acceptable - beloved, even. Those kind of innovations are a nice tie-breaker. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin:4rem 0;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-animation/special-consideration.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>Persepolis</em></strong><br />
    Anime junkies will argue for <em>Princess Mononoke</em> here, while Disney die-hards often consider <em>Pinocchio</em> to be Walt’s early-era masterpiece. But <em>Persepolis</em> is an excellent and important film not made by the two titans of animation that definitely deserves a place in the conversation of greatest animated films of all-time.

				<description>
  				<![CDATA[
  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/a-z-comedy.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear Comedy Fans, <br />
  				<p>Making a video about the greatest comedies of all time is serious stuff. Well, we took it seriously, anyway. </p>

<p>This is the second instalment in our <strong>Greatest Movies A-Z</strong> series with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg">WatchMojo</a>, and it might have been the hardest of all. As tempting as it is to just stick to Will Farrell movies that make us laugh, we had the whole history of cinema to contend with. A rich, hilarious history which we hope this video serves as a nice reminder. Enjoy. </p>

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="624" height="351" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/WQYfRc0aYoA?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>Again, we gave ourselves some guidelines:</p>

<ol>
<li>One film per letter</li>
<li>Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)</li>
<li>Final list should encapsulate the genre</li>
</ol>

<p>The last rule dictated a lot of our hardest decisions. Sometimes you have to go with beloved movies even if you don’t personally love them (looking at you, <em>Caddyshack</em>). </p>

<p>So here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission.</p>

<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM COMEDY A-Z</p>

<p>Now that this first video is out, here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission. </p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-comedy/top-decade.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>TOP DECADE: 1980s</strong><br />
        The 1980s have the most films on the list, suggesting some generational bias. The 70s and 90s are also well represented. The last 20 years have it rough: there’s not a single movie here from the 2010s. They just don’t make ‘em like they used to! And by that, we mean in the 20s and 30s (it’s not nostalgia - those movies we included are <em>still</em> great).
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">

    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>HARDEST LETTER: G</strong><br />
        G, didn’t expect that! If a Charlie Chaplin vs Buster Keaton face-off wasn’t enough (<em>The Great Dictator</em> vs <em>The General</em>), what about the 1-2 punch of Bill Murray’s all-time classics <em>Groundhog Day</em> and <em>Ghostbusters</em>? Or maybe we meet halfway in the timeline with <em>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</em>? Instead, we played some politics, giving Keaton the G film and pushing <em>Groundhog Day</em> to another genre, and having Marilyn Monroe “settle” for the still pitch perfect comedy <em>Some Like it Hot</em>. <em>Ghostbusters</em> just didn’t make the call of a pure comedy - it’s so much more.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Runner-up: A</strong>. <em>Anchorman</em> vs <em>Ace Ventura</em> vs <em>Austin Powers</em> - come on!<br />
        <br />
        <strong>2nd Runner-up: B.</strong> <em>Blazing Saddles</em> vs <em>The Big Lebowski</em> vs _Bridesmaids_… see why we said this genre was the hardest??</p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">

    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>Lost in America</em></strong><br />
        It’s a Criterion Collection comedy (which is pretty rare), and just a hell of a funny ride. But the video was getting a little bro-centric. Even though Reese Witherspoon double dips with <em>Election</em>, <em>Legally Blonde</em> was just too big and beloved not to recognize.

        <strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>Wayne’s World</em> <strong>vs</strong> <em>What’s Up, Doc?</em></strong><br />
        Wayne and Garth would probably claim they aren’t worthy of taking out screen queen Barbara Streisand in <em>What’s Up, Doc?</em>, but _Wayne’s World_really holds up. Still, we banged our heads against the wall for a while, then just went with our gut. Asphinctersayswhat?

        You’re either thinking <em>hell yes!</em> this movie made the cut, or <em>what the hell</em>? The film snob in us definitely fought for <em>Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</em>. The film historian part of our brain mounted a solid argument for the Marx Brothers’ <em>Duck Soup</em>. But at the risk of our pets losing their heads, we just had to respect the biggest comedy star of the 90s in one of the dumbest, funniest movies of a generation

				<title> Feature: Horror Movies: A-Z</title>
				<description>
  				<![CDATA[
  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/a-z-horror.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear Horror Fans, <br />
  				<p>You know what’s really scary? Committing to a list of the all-time best horror films. </p>

<p>As the first video in our new Greatest Movies A-Z series with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg">WatchMojo</a>, we knew it wouldn’t be easy. That doesn’t mean we knew it would be so hard. But here it is:</p>

<div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TsZ1naZczHc?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>As you can see, we gave ourselves some guidelines:</p>

<ol>
<li>One film per letter</li>
<li>Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)</li>
<li>Final list should encapsulate the genre</li>
</ol>

<p>The last rule dictated a lot of our hardest decisions. And we’re confident with where we ended up - especially after a last minute change to replace <em>Killer Klowns from Outer Space</em> with <em>King Kong</em>. </p>

<p>(Seriously. We almost forgot <em>King Kong</em> was a horror movie. That would have gotten ugly).</p>

<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM HORROR A-Z</p>

<p>Now that this first video is out, here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission. </p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-horror/top-decade.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>TOP DECADE: 1970s</strong><br />
        Nine of our choices come from the 70s. Every one of them has a sequel and/or remake. The decade really set the template for modern horror. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-horror/hardest-letter.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>HARDEST LETTER: P</strong><br />
        <em>Paranormal Activity</em>. <em>Poltergeist</em>. <em>The Purge<em>. </em>Pet Cemetary</em>.  All extremely successful and important to the genre, but they ultimately have to bow down to the mother of mainstream horror: <em>Psycho</em>.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-horror/cheated-out.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>Alien</em></strong><br />
        Is <em>Alien</em> a horror movie? Sure. But it fit better in another genre, so we didn’t even consider it here. Don’t worry, we can hear you scream. 
    </p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">

    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>Scream</em> vs <em>The Shining</em></strong><br />
        If you think we’re crazy for not going with Kubrick, trust us, we know. <em>The Shining</em> is a bona fide classic, and has had a real cultural resurgence since <em><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/4/9/room-237.html">Room 237</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2018/4/3/ready-player-one.html">Ready Player One</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2019/11/12/doctor-sleep.html">Doctor Sleep</a></em>. But <em>Scream</em> single-handedly rejuvenated the horror genre in the mid 90s. It spawned three sequels, countless imitators, and even a spoof series (<em>Scary Movie</em>) that got all the way to a fifth instalment. Not to mention how the original <em>Scream</em> still totally slaps as a horror movie. The best argument against it might be that we already have a Wes Craven film in <em>Nightmare on Elm Street</em>. But like <em>Scream</em>, we just had to play with the rules here.

    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>The Wizard of Gore</em></strong><br />
        Is it really better than <em><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/2/19/the-witch.html
">The Witch</a></em>? Probably not, but we had to throw some love at the buckets-of-blood king Herschell Gordon Lewis. Helped us round out the style of horror films on the list, too.

				<title>Review: The Invisible Man</title>
				<description>
  				<![CDATA[
  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/the-invisible-man.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear Harry Dakanalis, Motion Control Supervisor, <br />
  				<p>No one obsesses over someone’s invisible movements as much as you do. It’s your job to anticipate where someone could be and remember all their previous steps in order to see the full picture, even when others can’t. All made possible by some fancy new cameras.</p>

<p>Maybe Elisabeth Moss was stalking <em>you</em> in preparation for this role.  </p>

<p>Moss’s character in <em>The Invisible Man</em> is the victim of an abusive ex-boyfriend who gets inside her head, and eventually, her bedroom, without anyone else understanding how he could be so ever-present in her life. This is a Blumhouse thriller, not a purely psychological drama, so the villain is also a world-leading optics pioneer capable of such (literal) invisible stalking. But science is the last thing on writer and director Leigh Whanell’s mind. He made a genre film with an agenda. Basically, <em>It Follows</em> so <em>Get Out</em> of <em>A Quiet Place</em>. And <em>The Invisible Man</em> actually belongs in the conversation with those titans of new wave horror. </p>

<p>While you were tracking technical details, making sure that shots stitch together and track character movement, Whanell’s script has its sights set on the big picture. As a result, <em>The Invisible Man</em> is the first truly great film sprung from the #MeToo movement (apologies to <em>Bombshell</em>, <em>The Assistant</em>, <em>Support the Girls</em>, et al.). It delivers all the visceral suspense and thrills one expects from this type of outing, with a healthy dose of the female glare (what I’ll call the distrustful reaction to the infamous “male gaze”). By locking the audience&#39;s perspective to that of the victim, we experience first-person terror that feels miles apart from the pervy voyeur-o-vision we’ve come to expect from <em>Hollow Man</em> or the Translucent anti-superhero from “The Boys” TV series. It’s not just refreshing in a politically woke sense, it’s actually more effective as a film.</p>

<p>Much to your delight, I&#39;m sure, (and mine) the film isn’t trying to impress anyone with a floating fedora and sunglasses. Enough is withheld visually to almost believe, for a while, that maybe Moss’s character is going over the deep end, paranoid without real justification. The title of the film, of course, vindicates her from the start, but Whanell doesn’t let that prevent us from experiencing some skepticism ourselves as she seems to unravel. Until, of course, the shark comes out of the water and she has to face the terror head on.</p>

<p>In fact, the final act of the film proves as adept of an accomplishment in action filmmaking as the early part of the film is patient and deceptive with negative space. This transition in filmmaking styles doesn’t seem like it should work, but in practice it is wildly effective. I guess sometimes you just have to see to believe.</p>

				<title> Feature: Face it, The Last Black Man in San Francisco is the Best Film of 2019</title>
				<description>
  				<![CDATA[
  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/face-it-the-last-black-man-in-san-francisco-is-the-best-film-of-2019.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear Fellow Critics, <br />
  				<p>If aliens were to come across a random list of everyone’s favourite films of 2019, they’d see a solid run-down of predictable awards season fare - a good chunk of which might make them think, “Wow, these Earthlings sure love their normalizing takes on very bad/dumb men,” BUT I digress. </p>

<p>It’s not that the titles buzzing on everyone’s lips aren’t good – I liked most of them a lot. However, for me, 2019 at the movies was good, but not knock-my-socks-off good; solid entertainment, but not worth all the hype. And yes, hard eye roll to all the giddy adulation for films that bend over backwards to explain why shitty, dangerous men are shitty and dangerous and why we should feel sorry for them, but make no actual point beyond that. ANYWAY.</p>

<p>Enough about Hollywood and its dumb men. To talk about <em>my</em> favourite film of 2019, we’re going to have to venture outside the Kingdom of Whitemaleia. I’m happy to finally have a chance to talk about Joe Talbot’s <em>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</em>, the only thing I saw last year that was still in my head two days later. I was not expecting a film about two black men struggling with issues surrounding poverty, displacement, and belonging to be the most relatable film I saw all year, but that is exactly why it’s at the top of my list. </p>

<p>I visited San Francisco once, many years ago. I had a fun few days, but didn’t see or do much beyond the usual touristy stuff. I certainly never saw anything of Jimmie and Mont’s San Francisco, and probably missed a lot of the film’s ‘inside’ jokes and references that would resonate with San Franciscan audiences, so I was surprised at how easily and deeply I connected with the story and characters. And it’s not just because, as a Torontonian, I can relate to real estate panic and a looming sense of displacement deep down into my toes. From city to city, as housing crises keep getting worse, conversations about affordability and belonging are often clumsy and vicious, dominated by the loudest and meanest among us. A film like <em>The Last Black Man…</em> invites us to think a little deeper on belonging and the notion of selfhood, and how it is tied to our concept of home and place. It explores the different ways in which we say, “I belong here;” for people like Jimmie, it’s about owning physical space; for others, like Mont, belonging is established and emphasized in the stories and written records of our experiences in and of a place. </p>

<p>The great thing about <em>The Last Black Man…</em> is that, with so much going on, Talbot deftly maintains a perfect balance between pathos and humour. The narrative gets deeply political at times, but this is not the type of film that will inspire outrage. It offers no solutions or suggestions regarding displacement, and arguably doesn’t even come down as hard on gentrification as one might expect. It raises questions around the concept of belonging, but doesn’t leave you too unsettled by the end. I keep coming back to <em>The Last Black Man…</em> in my head not just because I can relate to the story, but also because of its many small, perfect moments - certain shots, or numbers on the soundtrack that randomly make me smile when I remember them. It also earns major bonus points for providing respite from the impotent male rage that practically drenched big and small screens all damn year. Seriously, here’s to privileged dudes being a little less off their faces on their persecution complexes in 2020 but probably not because who are we even kidding. </p>

  				<p>Dear Lee Smith, Editor, <br />
  				<p>Congratulations on a job well done in Sam Mendes’ <em>1917</em>, or <em>WWI: First Person Shooter</em>. I’m not being snarky, it really is such a great film. Much has been made of Mendes’ script (co-written with Krysty Wilson-Cairns), based on the wartime experiences of his own grandfather. However, while it is a good story, your editing and Roger Deakins’ cinematography is arguably the main draw. </p>

<p>The cinematography and editing that make the film look like one long take are rightly at the forefront of the conversation on <em>1917</em>. ‘Invisible editing’ on such a massive scale is undoubtedly difficult to pull off, and you make it look – well, seamless. Quite honestly, I was more into the visual and stylistic wizardry on display than the narrative. The story is a very basic hero’s quest, and there is very little meaty plot beyond that. There is also very little time devoted to character development, but then I’ve never really considered that to be a cornerstone of a war film, where I’d argue the general rule is not to get too attached to anyone onscreen.</p>

<p>And yet, I have heard and read some criticism that <em>1917</em> is ‘too much like a video game’, and that it suffers from a lack of time spent with the characters. I’d argue that both these things actually make it a stronger film. <em>1917</em> is more of an experience than a story, and setting the protagonist up to move through his environment as though playing through a first-person shooter actually works really well. Character development is contained to brief ‘cut scenes’, but there are still plenty of very powerful, moving moments in between all the shooting and explosions.</p>

<p>I can understand how some viewers might have felt a little stiffed; the trailer for the film spotlights a roster of some of the biggest British movie stars out there, making it seem like they will each have significant screen time. In fact, each of them is barely on screen for two minutes, and I found that cheeky and hilarious. Dangling Benedict Cumberbatch and Colin Firth in front of my nose only to have them utter three lines and disappear into the trenches is a pretty baller move – although a few more minutes of Andrew Scott would have earned you the extra 0.5 to make this a 5-star review. Just saying. </p>

<p>I usually have a tough time with war films because my brain tends to click off beyond a certain point of unrelenting noise and visual chaos, but I found <em>1917</em> to be much easier viewing. Your pacing achieves a balance between kaboom and quiet that allows full appreciation for the most intensely violent moments, but also the opportunity to regroup and absorb the progression of the narrative, while still keeping the viewer engaged and moving along with our hero from one level – sorry, <em>scene</em> – to the next. </p>
