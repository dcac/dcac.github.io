				<title>Tusk</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ll be up front and say that if I hadn&amp;#39;t known beforehand that Johnny Depp would appear in &lt;em&gt;Tusk _under a pseudonym – a &amp;quot;secret&amp;quot; that everybody and their grandmother seems to know by this point – I would never have recognized him. So you deserve some props for that. However, while he&amp;#39;s hidden beneath that brilliant makeup, Depp (or &amp;quot;Lapointe&amp;quot;) overacts to such a horrific degree that&amp;#39;s it&amp;#39;s almost unbearable to watch. Which is indicative of the problem with _Tusk&lt;/em&gt; as a whole: it never seems sure what type of movie it&amp;#39;s trying to be. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let&amp;#39;s take, for instance, a late-in-the-game flashback sequence in which his retired homicide detective recalls the time hefirst met the film&amp;#39;s villain, played by Michael Parks. I sat in my seat, utterly aghast, as the two actors stared awkwardly at each other, forcing out allegedly humorous dialogue (apparently faux-Quebecois accents are Kevin Smith&amp;#39;s idea of biting satire) in a bit that goes on for so long that the unspooling of quantum time ceases to retain any meeting. And then, all of a sudden, Lapointe returns to the present and somberly states that he was once missed an opportunity to save one of Parks&amp;#39; victims. I&amp;#39;m sure you&amp;#39;ll agree that there are talented filmmakers out there who can walk the line between humour and tragedy. Kevin Smith, sadly, doesn&amp;#39;t seem to be one of them.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It isn&amp;#39;t much of a surprise that &lt;em&gt;Tusk&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;s biggest issue is how it treats it&amp;#39;s central character, Wallace Bryton of the Not-See Party podcast. [As an aside: did you ever stick around on the set once Depp&amp;#39;s makeup was applied, and, if so, did you notice Smith quietly chuckling to himself every time a character mistakes &amp;quot;Not-See Party&amp;quot; for &amp;quot;Nazi Party&amp;quot;? I feel like that would have made for a pretty unpleasant drinking game.]&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Anyhoo...as soon as we meet Bryton, he&amp;#39;s already such a loud, crude, belligerent asshole (for lack of a better term) that it&amp;#39;s impossible sympathize when Parks abducts him and reveals his plans to surgically alter him into a man-walrus hybrid. To be fair, the initial reveal is by far the funniest moment of the film; the group I saw the film with was nearly in tears. And yet, we&amp;#39;re also supposed to empathize with Wallace, even though he&amp;#39;s the focus of a goofy sight-gag one second, then tearfully reflecting upon his lost humanity in the next. The wild tonal shifts are enough to give you whiplash.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To that point, the ludicrous design of Wallace the Walrus makes it abundantly clear that we&amp;#39;re supposed to be laughing &lt;em&gt;at&lt;/em&gt; him; Smith never attempts to hide just how artificial the costume really is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s odd that such a messy film would have a villain as compelling as Michael Parks. As goofy as the material is, he imbues the character with an interesting mix od madness and sadness, all slowly revealed as the reasons for his walrus-love become apparent. It&amp;#39;s captivating stuff, but given how scattershot the rest of the film is, it&amp;#39;s a safe assumption that this speaks more to Parks&amp;#39; strength as an actor than it does to the quality of the material he was working with &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I really don&amp;#39;t know how I could sell someone on this movie. It certainly doesn&amp;#39;t work as a horror movie. Or even a thriller. And yet, there&amp;#39;s really nothing funny about it. Here&amp;#39;s hoping that your actor-concealment skills are put to better use in the future.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Citizen Marc</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;At one time or another everyone has wanted to be a superhero. Who hasn&amp;#39;t imagined what it would feel like to stand victorious, fist raised, cape flowing? There&amp;#39;s something honourable about battling evil, about wanting to make the world a better place. There&amp;#39;s also something distinctly adolescent about the idea. It appeals to our basest desires of wanting to be powerful and universally adored. But isn&amp;#39;t fighting a noble cause supposed to be a reward in itself? Isn&amp;#39;t that why, after the villain is vanquished, Bruce Wayne, Peter Parker, and Clark Kent don&amp;#39;t stick around waiting for the news vans to show up?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Apparently all the comic books that marijuana activist Marc Emery read as a kid were missing the last page.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Interspersed between numerous news clips and interviews in the documentary &lt;em&gt;Citizen Marc&lt;/em&gt;, your animations depict Emery as a bespectacled, chiseled superhero with a receding hairline, battling against the Big Bad Government of Canada—and anyone else who dares keep him from his goal of legalizing marijuana. The tone is perfectly balanced between mockery and begrudging admiration. After all, Emery may be a cartoonish megalomaniac, but he also may be right when he claims to have done more than anyone else to advance the marijuana movement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Citizen Marc&lt;/em&gt;, instead of lionizing Emery, portrays him as a narcissistic mercenary. This is clear in his origin story: Emery&amp;#39;s love affair with the almighty dollar began as a pre-teen, when he started selling comics to friends, an endeavour that he tells us soon had him earning more than his father. At seventeen, Emery dropped out of school and bought the City Lights bookstore in London, Ontario, the site of what he calls &amp;quot;The Prophecy&amp;quot;. A woman fell in front of his store and had a vision of three symbols pertaining to him: a dollar sign, a spiky leaf, and a brain with a cage around it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It could only be more ridiculous if he was bitten by an infected spider. Oh yeah, &lt;a href=&quot;http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Canada/2011/07/17/18432866.html&quot;&gt;that happened too.&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike most superheroes, who are content to toil away in obscurity, Emery seems to get stronger with every self-aggrandizing publicity stunt. Sure he&amp;#39;s the Prince of Pot, but he&amp;#39;s also the King of Over-Sharing. It must have been difficult for you and the filmmakers to decide just which period of his life to animate. But you chose well. Against a black background, you outline our caped cannabis crusader in white with the initials M E on his chest, dropping green seeds over the world in his attempt to &amp;quot;overgrow the government.&amp;quot; You show this Ayn Rand-loving libertarian shoveling money into a fire as he buys his way into politics. You depict this sound-bite machine as a modern-day Moses, who inserts himself into religious imagery and bathes in cannabis oil (like Jesus, he claims), referring to his toker acolytes as &amp;quot;the chosen people.&amp;quot; Your simple black and white animation is the perfect juxtaposition for a man whose ideology is painted in broad strokes of grey.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In all superhero movies there are the innocent bystanders who watch helplessly as their city gets hijacked. &lt;em&gt;Citizen Marc&lt;/em&gt; shows us that it&amp;#39;s not the citizens themselves, but their movement that is being hijacked by Emery&amp;#39;s ego (which, one of his detractors observes, &amp;quot;is 40% of his body weight&amp;quot;). The narrator tells us, over your animation of Emery throwing fireballs at a sentient government building, that his capitalist views and anti-government message aligns him more closely with the Republican agenda. This plays rather strikingly against the footage of Gandhi and Martin Luther King—two masters of civil disobedience to whom Emery guilelessly compares himself.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We all know how superheroes get around; Superman is faster than a speeding bullet, Spiderman has his webs, and Batman has a flashy car. &lt;em&gt;Citizen Marc&lt;/em&gt; seems content to let The Prince of Pot hoist himself by his own petard.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>St. Vincent</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;It must be fun to shape a character from scratch. When you design wearable cosmetic enhancements to help an actor define a specific role, you get to see your work literally come to life. Be it a knobby nose, a bulbous chin – or, in the case of Naomi Watts&amp;#39; Baltic hooker, a baby bump – your work informs a character&amp;#39;s backstory (and, in this instance, her future). When we see a pregnant woman, we instantly understand where her life is headed. Similarly, when we see Bill Murray playing a rumpled, boorish reprobate, we know it&amp;#39;s gonna be exactly what we expect. And in &lt;em&gt;St. Vincent&lt;/em&gt;, his trademark offbeat charm doesn&amp;#39;t disappoint.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vincent is a misanthropic, alcoholic war vet whose life of quiet decrepitude is disturbed by the arrival of his new next-door neighbours: the recently divorced Maggie and her lonely son Oliver. Maggie begrudgingly relies on Vincent to mind Oliver after school, unaware that the old man&amp;#39;s babysitting repertoire includes trips to the racetrack, boxing lessons, and visits from Daka, a pregnant prostitute with the requisite heart of gold. But when Vincent&amp;#39;s financial and emotional issues threaten his relationship with Oliver, he must come to terms with his untenable existence.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Depending on the film, your job requires you to create something incredibly convincing or something over-the-top and obvious. Daka&amp;#39;s fake tan, fake nails, fake eyelashes, along with Naomi Watts&amp;#39; very fake Eastern European accent, make her realistic baby belly stick out—and not necessarily in the way you intended. Perhaps first-time feature director and writer Theodore Melfi relies too heavily on clichéd cinematic shorthand instead of trusting his characters and their actions to move the story forward. The few relationships Vincent has – with Daka, his bookie, his bartender, and Maggie and Oliver – are all strained. Yet they never seem beyond repair. The tension, therefore, feels manufactured. Luckily, though much of the drama is telegraphed, the cast – particularly newcomer Jaeden Lieberher as Oliver – has enough chemistry to overcome the unexceptional script&amp;#39;s shortcomings.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The materials used to create prosthetics haven&amp;#39;t changed much in the last few decades, so it&amp;#39;s technique that separates a layperson from an artist. &lt;em&gt;St. Vincent&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t try too hard to stand out in the reluctant father-figure genre (think &lt;em&gt;The Bad News Bears, Bad Santa&lt;/em&gt;, and, most notably, &lt;em&gt;About A Boy&lt;/em&gt;, from which St. Vincent cribs a lot, right down to the schoolyard bullies and the student assembly climax). Maybe because it knows it doesn&amp;#39;t have to. Bill Murray is that rare actor whose very presence is enough to convince the audience that what they&amp;#39;re about to see is a cut above the rest. When Vincent cracks his head open trying to chip some ice for a drink, Murray achieved that perfect balance of funny/pathetic.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You created a scab prosthetic for his forehead. It gradually heals over the course of the film, as Vincent, predictably, grows as a person. But with Murray the progression is never boring.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Left Behind</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;You don&amp;#39;t know this, but you shaped my childhood in a large way. My father is super into End Times Prophecy, and my family used to watch &lt;em&gt;This Week In Bible Prophecy&lt;/em&gt; (the show you co-hosted with your brother Peter), which disseminated how the weekly world news was actually fulfilling the prophecies of Revelation. My dad also read several of Tim LaHaye&amp;#39;s (co-author of the &lt;em&gt;Left Behind&lt;/em&gt; series of novels) &amp;quot;non-fiction&amp;quot; works, so I am well-versed on your theological stance.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I&amp;#39;m not here to debate that. I&amp;#39;m here to talk about your storytelling skills.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Somehow, I came into this movie without ever having read the novels or seeing the first trilogy of films based on them. I had fresh eyes. I also tried &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; hard not to let my now-atheistic beliefs bias me against your film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But here&amp;#39;s the thing: despite the surprisingly competent – dare I say &lt;em&gt;good&lt;/em&gt; - performances of the film&amp;#39;s stars, they really didn&amp;#39;t have much to work with. The only two things that really happen in the entire film are: 1) all the Christians and children suddenly disappear about halfway through, and 2) a plane almost crashes. That&amp;#39;s barely enough to sustain an episode of an hour-long television episode, let alone a 110-minute film (and I&amp;#39;m currently binge-watching the episodes of &lt;em&gt;Supernatural&lt;/em&gt; dealing with the Apocalypse, so I should know).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Religious beliefs aside, both the Rapture (an event which, strangely, is never referred to in the film as such) and the Apocalypse are fascinating stories that offer a lot of potential. It&amp;#39;s a shame you wasted them here. Maybe that&amp;#39;s the fault of Tim LaHaye and Jerry B. Jenkins - like I said, I haven&amp;#39;t read the source material, so I don&amp;#39;t know what you were working with - but, as the co-writer AND the producer, you had the opportunity to do more.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;One final aside: I know the producers make the final decision when it comes to the score, so you should know that it&amp;#39;s pretty shlocky at times.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Sincerely,&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;br&gt;
Diane Carol Harder&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Why Gone Girl Makes Me Sad for the State of Cinema</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Cinema,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You had a good run. Quite frankly, you changed the world. But in the 21&lt;sup&gt;st&lt;/sup&gt;
 century, the world has changed you. Look no further than David Fincher&amp;#39;s latest film &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; for proof.&lt;/strong&gt; &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It&amp;#39;s the canary in the cinematic coal mine.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; is a good film. &lt;a href=&quot;/content/2014/10/9/gone-girl.html&quot; title=&quot;Gone Girl review&quot;&gt;Almost a great film&lt;/a&gt;. It has a runtime of two and a half hours, but earns every minute – and then some. The story is juicy and complex, the performances are dialed in just right, and the plot twists are both frequent and fascinating. In any other era, &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; would have been worthy and welcomed in movie theaters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Today, &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; belongs on television. As a mini-series, where all great stories are told – unencumbered by the restraints of cinema.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, restraints. Less than a generation ago, TV was widely considered a second-class medium. It was the domain of craftsmen instead of artists. A world filled with topical jokes and disposable drama. A place for censored stories and restrictive, sponsor-driven structures. Not to mention production limitations galore. Of course that&amp;#39;s no longer the case, as &lt;em&gt;Game of Thrones&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Boardwalk Empire&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Homeland&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Mad Men&lt;/em&gt;, and countless other TV programs have proved. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the new Golden Era of Television, the rulebook has been thrown out the window.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everyone heralds HBO as the game changer, but that channel is more poster child than messiah. Fantastic television mini-series have always existed (&lt;em&gt;Roots&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;North and South&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;Jesus of Nazareth&lt;/em&gt;), but today, the mini-series has become the gold standard for great storytelling. Turning to a mini-series for a rich, nuanced and ambitious story is no longer the exception, but the &lt;em&gt;expectation&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which brings us to &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt;. A film whose scope, scale and stars are all better suited for a serialized TV format.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;David Fincher should have known better. He&amp;#39;s one of the most exciting American directors working today, and a rare example of an auteur who doesn&amp;#39;t write his own screenplays. Fincher&amp;#39;s recently proven with &lt;em&gt;House of Cards&lt;/em&gt; that he&amp;#39;s the perfect candidate for helming a mini-series, which makes his &amp;quot;step-backwards&amp;quot; into cinema all the more frustrating.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have not read Gillian Flynn&amp;#39;s much-loved book, so this is certainly not one of those complaints about &amp;quot;how much better the book was&amp;quot;. Flynn did a fine job adapting the screenplay herself. How do I know this? Because by the film&amp;#39;s third act, I was craving more time with the characters, more detail about their relationships and more scope to the story. It could be &lt;em&gt;because&lt;/em&gt; I didn&amp;#39;t read the book that I wanted to savour the story even more. And why I felt the weakness of film as a medium.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After the delicately paced first act of &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt;, the twists and turns almost start to feel rushed as the film gains momentum. Character turns become pulpy instead of relatable. There are moments of revelation that almost beg the audience to take a breather to reflect and engage in conversation, the way you can with a mini-series. Instead we barrel forward to the climax and a time-crunching denouement.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Part of me craves the discussion that a mini-series affords before everything is wrapped up and answered for us. How can I not? The past year alone has brought us &lt;em&gt;True Detective&lt;/em&gt;, &lt;em&gt;The Honourable Woman&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Knick&lt;/em&gt;. Even a film like &lt;em&gt;Fargo&lt;/em&gt; – which is a clinic in economical storytelling – lead to a dreaded-but-surprisingly-incredible re-imagining of that story. And at no time did that story seem stretched out or watered down on the small screen – it felt completely at home.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Don&amp;#39;t take this the wrong way, Cinema, but to be worthy of a mini-series today is a wonderful thing. It&amp;#39;s probably the best medium for entertainment we have right now, so you really need to go big, or we&amp;#39;ll go home. Of course, there would be no justification for &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; to go any bigger. Everything was already scaled perfectly for a network to take on. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And that delicious story…&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You really can&amp;#39;t compare books and film. Think about it: it&amp;#39;s one thing for Michael Crichton to write about a park filled with dinosaurs, but it&amp;#39;s quite another to bring them to life in a way that&amp;#39;s &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/4/4/top-10-uncredited-heroes-of-jurassic-park.html&quot;&gt;still believable 20 years later.&lt;/a&gt; But the distinction between film and television is now almost non-existent. &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; proves that we live in an era where film can simply mean &amp;quot;less&amp;quot; than TV.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;So I guess when it comes to &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt;, I wanted more than you can offer. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Gone Girl</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Despite his famous ego as an auteur, Orson Welles paid a great compliment to Gregg Toland by sharing a title card with the cinematographer on &lt;em&gt;Citizen Kane&lt;/em&gt;. This crossed my mind as I saw your name in the opening credits for David Fincher&amp;#39;s thriller &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl.&lt;/em&gt; Your name&amp;#39;s not on the screen alongside Fincher&amp;#39;s, but the placement is telling.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sound designers, like you, are usually listed in the end credits — the end of the end credits, actually. Without going into the politics of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/5/9/neighbors.html&quot;&gt;movie credit hierarchy&lt;/a&gt;, I think it might be a bit of nod to the importance of your contribution that your name is listed so highly.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; is directed by David Fincher — often referred to as one of the most stylistically baroque filmmakers working today. So you might expect a sound design to match. But Fincher&amp;#39;s come a long way since the days of &lt;em&gt;Alien 3, Seven&lt;/em&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;Fight Club&lt;/em&gt;. He&amp;#39;s now one of Hollywood&amp;#39;s most consistently reliable directors for turning in smart, exquisitely crafted dramas (let&amp;#39;s all agree to overlook &lt;em&gt;The Curious Case of Benjamin Button&lt;/em&gt;, shall we?) that know exactly when—and more importantly when &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt;—to go over the top. Fittingly, your sound design here syncs up perfectly with this more understated approach. And thank God for that.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;ve grown increasingly tired with modern sound design where everything, diagetic or not, needs a sound effect. Everything. I don&amp;#39;t know exactly when this started, but I became acutely aware of it in the mid 90s, around the time foley artists decided cigarettes needed to make a burning sound whenever a character took a drag. Little did I know we were heading into an era where even filmmaking techniques—camera pans, fades edits—would have their own library of sound effects. So much for the invisible arts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But Fincher, a savant to film craft if there ever was one, is far too smart to fall for these trappings. By taking everything—your sound design included, Ren—down to their basic, least intrusive forms, Fincher creates a setting that feels natural even as events start to go, well, bananas. Gillian Flynn&amp;#39;s 2012 novel is well-known for some pretty out-there plot twists, and her script keeps the craziness in-tact. Fincher and all of his collaborators respond to this, toning everything else down. And it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alfred Hitchcock famously said that tension was created when the audience knew more than the characters did. The camera, providing an omniscient point of view, could reveal details to us that the characters could not know. In &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl,&lt;/em&gt; Fincher and Flynn flip this premise on its head. Ben Affleck&amp;#39;s Nick Dunne returns home on his fifth wedding anniversary to find his wife Amy missing, and signs of a struggle in the house. After bringing in the authorities to investigate, Dunne quickly becomes the prime suspect. Did he do it or not? That&amp;#39;s the question that preoccupies much of &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The anti-Hitchcock element here is that the one person who knows this answer for sure—Dunne—is both our point-of-entry to the story and an opaque mystery. Where something like &lt;em&gt;The Fugitive&lt;/em&gt; gets its righteous propulsion from our knowledge that Richard Kimble is innocent, &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; asks us to invest ourselves in someone who might very well be a murderer. Again, and against the odds, it works.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Casting Affleck as Dunne may be the film&amp;#39;s greatest strength: Affleck brings just enough &amp;quot;how could this happen to a fun-loving guy like me?&amp;quot; entitlement that, along with the more tangible character faults of Dunne himself, make us want to question his every motive. That Rosamund Pike as Amy, the titular girl, represented almost entirely in flashbacks informed by her own diary entries gives us one more level of remove from Dunne — and one more reason not to trust him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that&amp;#39;s just part of what &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; has in store. As the film moves from its early procedural tone to something much more outlandish, it actually starts to feel like a combination of both the old and new Fincher, specifically a grafting together of &lt;em&gt;Zodiac&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;The Game&lt;/em&gt;. And as things get crazier—and lets face it, much of &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt;&amp;#39;s second half is flat out ridiculous – your sound design goes along for the ride. I&amp;#39;m not saying you ever go full-out-Tony-Scott-sound-design crazy, but the sound definitely starts to become a bigger presence near the end. As it does this, though, the film itself shifts tone again, trading in claustrophobic thriller for something approaching black comedy.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;These are all subtle changes, mind you. The intentional shifts in the film&amp;#39;s style give us permission to enjoy &lt;em&gt;Gone Girl&lt;/em&gt; for the tawdry, insane narrative it is. That&amp;#39;s a tricky balancing act to pull off without turning into a parody, but everyone involved does just that.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Night Moves</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;I can&amp;#39;t think of a worse gig for someone like you than a Kelly Reichardt film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you&amp;#39;ve seen her earlier work – notably &lt;em&gt;Wendy and Lucy&lt;/em&gt; or &lt;em&gt;Meek&amp;#39;s Cutoff&lt;/em&gt; (both starring Michelle Williams) – you&amp;#39;ve undoubtedly noticed the simultaneously essential and throwaway nature of mixing the location sound. In order to achieve her distinctive brand of neo-realism, Reichardt often forces the audience to strain to make out the mumbled dialogue hidden behind campfire crackles or desert winds. At other times, she will eschew dialogue completely for 15 minutes at a time and just let the simplest location sounds support her minimal aesthetics. This might have lead you to assume that &lt;em&gt;Night Moves&lt;/em&gt; would be either the easiest job of your life, or the hardest. But that wasn&amp;#39;t the case, was it? &lt;em&gt;Night Moves&lt;/em&gt; probably turned out to be just another job, the same way it turned out to be just another film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Reichardt, a true American auteur, has decided to take a modest step towards the commercial center in this story about environmental activists plotting to destroy a hydro dam. The narrative, motivations, and dialogue, are all fairly clear and easy to follow. Her trademark wandering characters are in control for most of this film, and her technical approach follows suit. The lighting is sparse and natural, the camera is slow and distant, and your location sound is dialed back but ever-present. This time, however, Jeff Grace&amp;#39;s soundtrack is covering much more of the transitions and mood shifts. It all ends up feeling a little too conventional, especially after the bold impression she left with her last film, &lt;em&gt;Meek&amp;#39;s Cutoff&lt;/em&gt;.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Still, this is far from a standard thriller. Reichardt is once again exploring the relationship between people and nature, but in a much more aggressive and direct approach than in the past. Jesse Eisenberg, in the central role, gives a restrained and introspective performance, but his co-stars Dakota Fanning and Peter Saarsgard are allowed to play within a slightly wider and more relatable range. They can smile, be sarcastic and openly debate consequences rather than bottle them all up inside. Perhaps this is why their character arcs are more sympathetic than Eisenberg&amp;#39;s.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But of course, it&amp;#39;s what&amp;#39;s &lt;em&gt;not&lt;/em&gt; being said or heard that usually makes Reichardt&amp;#39;s films unique. After toiling in independent obscurity for years, it&amp;#39;s hard to blame her for trying to make something less challenging on the audience. Except easy is never as rewarding – not for a viewer, and not even for a crew member like you.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Maze Runner</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Spoiler alert: teenagers are jerks. But I&amp;#39;m sure I don&amp;#39;t have to tell a teacher that. In the ninth grade, when &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/em&gt; was handed out, I opened my copy to see that the kid who&amp;#39;d had the book before me had written &amp;quot;Piggy dies&amp;quot; on the first page. But for this heartless ballpoint scrawl, it may have taken me much longer to determine the fates of those characters. Unfortunately, the same can&amp;#39;t be said for the pedestrian young adult actioner, &lt;em&gt;The Maze Runner&lt;/em&gt;, which manages the impressive feat of making a homicidal labyrinth seem predictable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I&amp;#39;m sure, through the course of your career, you&amp;#39;ve had to read more than your fair share of book reports on the dystopian teen novel of the moment. The granddaddy of them all would be the aforementioned &lt;em&gt;Lord of the Flies&lt;/em&gt; (from which &lt;em&gt;The Maze Runner&lt;/em&gt; borrows liberally). There&amp;#39;s also &lt;em&gt;The Hunger Games&lt;/em&gt; Trilogy, the &lt;em&gt;Divergent&lt;/em&gt; Series, &lt;em&gt;The Giver&lt;/em&gt;—the list goes on, and you&amp;#39;ve no doubt become familiar with all the genre&amp;#39;s tropes. Sadly, so has the audience for these novel to film adaptations. Sure, the market is oversaturated, so it would be easy to say that &lt;em&gt;The Maze Runner&lt;/em&gt; suffers from a case of bad timing. But lack of originality isn&amp;#39;t the film&amp;#39;s biggest problem. It&amp;#39;s the lack of heart.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thomas is a 16 year-old who wakes up in a rusty box in the middle of a maze with no memory of his past. The centre of the maze, called The Glade, is inhabited by a group of boys who have been trying to find a way out with no luck. Thomas must convince the boys to give up the relative security of The Glade for a chance at freedom by risking escape through the ever-changing, monster-inhabited maze.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Kids are naturally curious, so spending your days with them means you have to be quick with answers. The biggest puzzle in this film is that none of the boys know where they came from or why they&amp;#39;re there. Which would be fine if the film wasn&amp;#39;t so reluctant to feed us any interesting clues. Without backstory it&amp;#39;s impossible to care about these boys, so, instead of characters we can root for, we get archetypes: Thomas, the fearless protagonist; Alby the damaged leader; Minho, the ethnic sidekick; Gally, the bully. We even get Chuck, the loveable fat kid.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You can guess what happens to him.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I wonder, as an adult authority figure, if you&amp;#39;ve ever had to utter the phrase, &amp;quot;Because I said so&amp;quot;? Even as you say it, you know it&amp;#39;s a weak argument. But it&amp;#39;s usually enough to placate the little brats, isn&amp;#39;t it? But only for so long. When the adults in &lt;em&gt;The Maze Runner&lt;/em&gt; do show up, it&amp;#39;s only to offer a Cole&amp;#39;s Notes explanation for their actions. By this point they&amp;#39;d lost all credibility. So, like a petulant child, I stopped listening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Your job exists because child labour laws require that minors working on a film set are supervised at all times. In addition to teaching, you have to ensure the health and welfare of the children in your charge—from watching what they eat at the craft service table, to making sure Teamsters don&amp;#39;t curse in front of them. You spend so much time with these kids that I&amp;#39;m sure you grow attached. In the case of &lt;em&gt;The Maze Runner&lt;/em&gt;, the teen cast is inordinately talented. But instead of being given fully fleshed-out characters to play, they&amp;#39;re primarily relegated to physical activity and/or exposition delivery. It doesn&amp;#39;t matter how ominous and imposing the maze is, or how terrifying the monster special effects are...if we&amp;#39;re not emotionally invested in the kids&amp;#39; future, the whole endeavour is a lesson in futility.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>My Old Lady</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;There is a certain stagnant claustrophobia in the sprawling Paris apartment that serves as the setting for Israel Horowitz&amp;#39;s screen adaptation of his play, &lt;em&gt;My Old Lady&lt;/em&gt;. I&amp;#39;ve had this feeling as a child when visiting the homes of elderly relatives. Apart from the furniture and decades of accumulated clutter, there is something intangible that blocks natural light and sucks the air out of the room, making you grateful for the first opportunity to step outside. I felt the same way watching this film, because Horowitz has the building blocks of what should be something truly remarkable, but instead he delivers something quite stale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When failed novelist and recovering alcoholic, Mathias Gold, played by Kevin Kline, inherits an apartment in Paris from his estranged father, he is eager to sell the place as soon as possible. The presence of Maggie Smith&amp;#39;s Mathilde, an elderly tenant, and her daughter, Chloe, played by Kristin Scott Thomas, combined with the weirdest real estate laws I have ever heard of, throw a wrench into his plans. Broke, and stuck paying rent to Mathilde for occupying a room in the apartment he now owns (like I said, weirdest laws ever), Mathias pokes around in various drawers and cupboards discovering hidden family secrets and scandals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Horowitz&amp;#39;s flippant dialogue is clever enough, and with powerhouse actors like Kline, Smith, and Scott Thomas, I expected great things. Instead, the film is just another adaptation that isn&amp;#39;t as good on screen as on stage. The plot feels misdirected, coming across as a charming romantic comedy at first, swerving clumsily into deep melodrama, and then back to whimsical love story. The apartment itself, though spacious and tastefully appointed, fosters a sense of tedium and inertia that clashes with the actors&amp;#39; increasingly animated performances. As deeper and darker grievances come to light, the cramped setting suffocates the performances to the point where they feel phoned in. This tug-of-war between the film&amp;#39;s stylistic elements ultimately jars the flow of the narrative. Take the soundtrack, for example. I get that every film set in Paris absolutely &lt;em&gt;must&lt;/em&gt; feature the same too-charming organ grinder/violin/accordion music, but it just doesn&amp;#39;t fit here. Following up the melodramatic emotional unravelling of your main character with an abrupt transition to that saccharine, tinny, &amp;#39;ah, l&amp;#39;amour&amp;#39; waltz-y business really kills the mood.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You did do a fine job giving Mathilde&amp;#39;s apartment (or is it Mathias&amp;#39; apartment? I still don&amp;#39;t actually know) that frozen-in-time quality that perfectly matches the mindset of its occupants. The space complements a narrative that treats the topics upon which it touches like dusty curios in an old room; childhood baggage, infidelity, and filial antagonisms are picked up, examined with mild interest, and set aside when the next, more interesting object is spied.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;While reasonably well-wrought on their own, the narrative and stylistic elements simply do not fit together, chafing against each other in a way that indicates an overall lack of certainty, resulting in a film that isn&amp;#39;t quite sure what it wants to be. To be fair, &lt;em&gt;My Old Lady&lt;/em&gt; is not without its charming moments, but they all take place in the brief sojourns from the main plot. Mathias&amp;#39; friendship with a local realtor, and a random riverside encounter with an opera singer brought a smile to my face, and made me wonder if Mathias &lt;em&gt;had&lt;/em&gt; to go home right then or if he could stay outside and play just a little while longer.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>This is Where I Leave You</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Some might find it strange that a dialogue-driven, ensemble dramedy like &lt;em&gt;This Is Where I Leave You&lt;/em&gt; required any stunts. Those people are probably only-children.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my brothers and I were kids, we used to stage fights. Mostly in slow-motion with the &amp;quot;nun-nun-nun-nun&amp;quot; sound effect from &lt;em&gt;The Six Million Dollar Man&lt;/em&gt; to accompany punches that purposely didn&amp;#39;t make contact. But sometimes we got into serious fights, with real blood and broken furniture and punches that were most certainly meant to connect. You must have siblings as well. From the fight scenes, stunt driving, and various choreographed physicality executed by you and your team, it would seem that you have a firm grasp of complex family dynamics.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Is Where I Leave You&lt;/em&gt; also fights a lot with its proverbial parent – the novel. The film suffers from the typical book-to-film adaptation problem where there&amp;#39;s just too much story to pack into 100 minutes. This film is genuinely funny, poignant, and true, with fine performances that unfortunately only scratch the surface of a deeper truth about family and forgiveness.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When the patriarch of the Altman family dies, his widow demands their four adult children spend the week mourning together in the family home. Which means the Altman siblings will regress, fight, mourn, and make some heavy life decisions over the course of those seven days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Middle son Judd takes a physical and emotional beating in this film, and Jason Bateman is certainly a deft enough actor to handle the challenge of skating the thin line between comedy and drama. It helps that you made sure the stunts never feel like slapsticky pratfalls. In an early scene, Judd attempts to break up a particularly ugly fight between his brothers and gets a piece of glass embedded in his forehead for his trouble. After a sufficiently appropriate pause, the rest of the family continues talking and eating like nothing happened. The scene is noteworthy, not because it&amp;#39;s played for humour, but because it&amp;#39;s played for honesty. This film reminds us that in a big family, you&amp;#39;re not more important than anyone else. You just have to take your lumps and move on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You could apply that philosophy to your job, which requires you to coordinate with many different departments - from makeup and costumes, to prop masters, effects coordinators, and of course, the producers and director. That&amp;#39;s a lot of egos to manage, and it&amp;#39;s important that they are all given equal consideration. It seems that director, Shawn Levy, felt the same way about his talent-heavy cast. Working from a screenplay adapted from Jonathan Tropper&amp;#39;s novel, Levy had a lot of character arcs to juggle, so it&amp;#39;s no surprise he had a hard time keeping them all in the air. In addition to Bateman, Jane Fonda, Tina Fey, Adam Driver, Corey Stoll, Kathryn Hahn, Rose Byrne, Timothy Olyphant, Dax Shepard and Connie Britton all punch well above their weight here with the juicy, multi-dimensional characters they get to play. But it&amp;#39;s too much of a good thing. While Levy was spoiled for choice, the audience is starving for a little depth of focus.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Regardless of a film&amp;#39;s genre, when stunts are done well they are suspenseful and clever, and exciting to watch. When done poorly, they&amp;#39;re confusing, repetitive and can bring the narrative to a screeching halt. The same can be said for ensemble pieces. The problem isn&amp;#39;t that &lt;em&gt;This Is Where I Leave You&lt;/em&gt; doesn&amp;#39;t hit all its marks, it&amp;#39;s that there are just too many marks to hit. And Levy tries to hit them all. Maybe he should have consulted you first.&lt;/p&gt;
