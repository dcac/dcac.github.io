				<title>Blackhat</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hollywood films love their technical advisors, be they military, science, or in your case, criminal. But being a technical advisor on a Michael Mann film must be a different kind of gig. The characters in Mann’s films are defined through their action—for Mann, action &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; character. And since much of the action of &lt;em&gt;Blackhat,&lt;/em&gt; exists in the netherworld of computer hacking, your expertise was no doubt essential in helping Mann create this very meticulous world.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Despite Mann’s pedigree, &lt;em&gt;Blackhat&lt;/em&gt; presents a problem that has flummoxed filmmakers for decades: How do you make a person sitting in front of a computer screen seem exciting, even cinematic?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on most of &lt;em&gt;Blackhat,&lt;/em&gt; Mann’s answer seems to be that you don’t—or, at least, that you don’t try too hard. He’s a savvy enough storyteller to know that the drama in any scene is about the shifting power dynamics between characters. Two men punching each other in a boxing ring, a gang of bank robbers shooting their way down an L.A. street, or a group of journalists simply trying to determine the legal ramifications of tortious interference can all create the same electricity for Mann, because what’s happening, no matter how small, matters to the characters.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I say “most of” &lt;em&gt;Blackhat&lt;/em&gt; because its opening scenes had me worried that Mann no longer trusted the audience—or himself—to experience action through character. As the film opens, we are assaulted by some pretty standard CGI-crafted shots that zoom in and out of computers, zipping along circuit boards, pushing almost to the atomic level in an attempt to visualize semiconductors coming to life in a mainframe as it is hacked by, well, by someone like you. I assume none of this sequence fell under your technical advisory, as it’s not very effective and more than a little silly. It had me worried that Mann had bought into the overpraise of special effects that a furious light and sound show could better deliver what a simple edit could convey: action and reaction. A man taps a keyboard, and somewhere on the other side of the world in China, a nuclear power plant’s cooling fan overheats and causes a meltdown. Anything in between those two events is only noise, reducing their impact. To see a filmmaker whose style is known mainly for its austere beauty fall victim to this at the film’s outset was disheartening.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Thankfully that’s the only such indulgence in &lt;em&gt;Blackhat,&lt;/em&gt; and after that opening scene, we move quickly into territory Mann is familiar with: criminals and the people who hunt them. Even though &lt;em&gt;Blackhat&lt;/em&gt; purports to be about your world’s particulars, it’s really about what all of Michael Mann’s movies are almost always about: the hunt. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And while &lt;em&gt;Blackhat&lt;/em&gt; might seem perfectly timed —especially for those of you in the Hollywood cyber security business— Mann has never been particularly interested in timeliness as much as he has been interested in his own pet themes; loyalty, friendship, vengeance. And although it is a film that takes place in a very modern world, &lt;em&gt;Blackhat&lt;/em&gt; feels most aligned with Mann’s 1981 debut film, &lt;em&gt;Thief.&lt;/em&gt; Structurally, these films are about as close to each other as anything Mann’s made (not counting his fill-in remake of 1989’s &lt;em&gt;L.A. Takedown&lt;/em&gt; as 1995’s &lt;em&gt;Heat&lt;/em&gt;).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Chris Hemsworth plays Nick Hathaway, an incarcerated hacker who is the only person who can possibly track down the mysterious man glimpsed in &lt;em&gt;Blackhat’s&lt;/em&gt; opening sequence. After the aforementioned nuclear reactor meltdown, Hathaway’s old college dorm mate who just happens to be a high level Chinese officer, convinces the United States government to free Hathaway (with a full pardon, of course) if he can help the authorities find and catch their man. When it comes to crime thrillers—even techno crime thrillers— the ground doesn’t come more well-trod than this.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Mann takes pleasure in showing a seasoned team of professionals excel at their craft. He takes the same strategy when directing actors, but the results are mixed. Some of the more famous faces, like Viola Davis’, take underwritten roles, and create characters that make an impression even when their place in the plot is a little too obvious. Other key roles suffer. Taiwanese actress Wei Tang benefits from Mann’s love of quiet moments, and though she’s an appealing screen presence and clearly talented, at times it sounds as if she learned the script phonetically. Hemsworth is solid, if unexceptional, as Hathaway, valiantly channeling his inner James Caan, but never matching the much-needed charisma of Mann’s best leading men. Yet for all its faults, and reliance on cliché, &lt;em&gt;Blackhat&lt;/em&gt; manages to stay its course.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Treading that edge between cliché and nuance is something Mann’s done throughout his directing career. He’s not afraid to write his themes in bold and then mark them with a highlighter. And if you’re not on Mann’s wavelength, it can be disastrous; earnestness becomes comical, big moments fall flat. But if you are in sync with him, a lot can be forgiven when those emotional highs lift you up. For a movie set in the impersonal world of computer hacking, and structured around the most familiar of genre conventions, &lt;em&gt;Blackhat&lt;/em&gt; succeeded for me—if only in a minor way—when it became truly personal. Its climactic scene is rooted in the low-tech in a very up-close-and-personal confrontation that unfolds amid what’s filmed to look like waves of humanity. It climaxes about as far away from cyberspace as possible.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ironically, it was only when your technical contributions—authentic as I’m sure they were—faded out of view that &lt;em&gt;Blackhat&lt;/em&gt; worked for me.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>American Sniper</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Great action movies demand great villains. What fun is a hero that parachutes into trouble, eliminates enemies with ease, and never once feels legitimately challenged? Hollywood has known this forever – and Clint Eastwood knows Hollywood. More importantly, he knows America. That’s important. As much as the “Sniper” part of this film might be the differentiator, it’s actually the ultra-classic “American” shooting style that makes the film work.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Which includes manufacturing and dispatching a parallel villain like you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now before you cry “spoiler alert!”, let me reiterate the American-ness of this film. America comes first in the title, and first for Eastwood. Failure is not an option, and ambiguity is not a strong suit of big studio films – especially old fashioned heroic myth-making like this one. Though I think they tried (more on that in a moment). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Based on the autobiography of American NAVY Seal Chris Kyle, credited with over 150 confirmed kills (and maybe a 100 more), this is the story of the deadliest sniper in American history. From the moment the novel was published (or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/making-american-sniper-how-an-760963&quot;&gt;planned, in fact&lt;/a&gt;), it was impossible that this story wouldn’t become a feature film. The question was, would it be another chest-pumping &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/1/9/lone-survivor.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Lone Survivor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, a politically detached &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/1/18/zero-dark-thirty.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Zero Dark Thirty&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;, or something in between? The first scene handles that question rather well, actually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Positioned on a rooftop in Iraq, your counterpart Kyle (played by a wildly bulked-up Bradley Cooper), is trying to decide whether or not to kill a “military-aged” man who is casually watching U.S. soldiers and making a phone call. See, unlike those easy target Americans you get to pick off, Al-Qaeda members don’t wear uniforms. So the deadly decision is Kyle’s alone to make. There’s also a woman and her young son below, who look like they’re handling a bomb and approaching the military convoy. Kyle’s spotter reminds him how, if he makes the wrong call, he’ll be shipped back to bootcamp (or something like that). Finger on the trigger, the story cuts away to life in America - pre-NAVY Seals, and pre-9/11 – to when Kyle was just a proud, rootin’ tootin’ Texas cowboy. Living the dream.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s actually a line in the film.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There’s more where that comes from. Rodeos, beer and fistfights are used less for character building than for familiar texture to cleanse our palette from the (other) dusty sand bowl of the Middle East, where most of the film takes place. Flashing back even further to when Kyle was a kid, we get some schoolyard bully scenes, child stoicism, and daddy issues. All text-book biopic back story. Maybe it’s true, maybe it’s not. It doesn’t matter. When Americans want to go to war (in a movie or otherwise), they know how to set it up to get the public on their side. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And viewed through the lens of classic American filmmaking,  &lt;em&gt;American Sniper&lt;/em&gt; actually hits all the required emotional beats with surprising ease and deftness. The cinematography is clean and easy to follow (with the notable exception of the finale), and the details seem to matter – from always having mud on the muzzle to wearing out the paint on the scope. It would be a little too easy for someone like me, or you, to stick a big target on this film and shoot it down for flag-waving patriotism. After all, the script at least introduces characters conflicted by the morality of their decisions (not you of course – the villain must stand for evil as truly as the hero stands for good).  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A more daring director might have taken cues from the script more seriously in the way it handled you. Making you a former Olympic champion does imbue a broader sense of accomplishment and humanity. But I can’t help but feel the conclusion was more wish fulfillment on Kyle’s part than objective resolution. Despite the textual evidence for that possibility, Eastwood wouldn’t dare deprive his American audience of the money shot.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, &lt;em&gt;American Sniper&lt;/em&gt; gets to be a little bit of everything for all people: a pure recruitment tool for the army, proof of the psychological consequences of war for pacifists, and an emotionally charged drama for the general public. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And for everyone on your side, probably just one more reason to hate America.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Inherent Vice</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;What more to expect from a film adapted from one of your novels than to be utterly confused, utterly compelled?  Your work sometimes feels like one big practical joke played on the reader - knotted allusions that may or may not connect, may or may not loop back on themselves, may or may not be allusions at all. And one might see Paul Thomas Anderson’s film adaptation of &lt;em&gt;Inherent Vice&lt;/em&gt; as a cruel trick perpetrated on the audience. And it might be. But if you’re in on the joke, if you’re willing to laugh at yourself, it’s a satisfying – and sometimes hilarious – experience. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inherent Vice&lt;/em&gt; was your take on the hard-boiled Raymond Chandler mode of detective story. The film version, to greater and lesser degrees, is Anderson’s take on Altman’s &lt;em&gt;The Long Goodbye&lt;/em&gt; (which, of course, was based on a Chandler novel). It’s the sort of fantasy drafting that film geeks propose over pints of craft beer. The Los Angeles described in your novel is the same peripheral Los Angeles that Anderson has been plundering for inspiration since &lt;em&gt;Boogie Nights&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Magnolia&lt;/em&gt;. It’s a drowsy, yellowed, desperate L.A full of drifters, druggies, and losers, far from the mansions of Beverly Hills, the hip night spots, and the movie premieres.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When &lt;em&gt;Inherent Vice&lt;/em&gt; was published in 2009, it was greeted with much respect but little enthusiasm. Sam Anderson ripped the novel in &lt;em&gt;New York&lt;/em&gt; Magazine, writing that you were “clearly having a postmodern blast warping the building blocks of detective fiction—causation, probability, significance, suspense. But it’s not quite so much fun for the reader. It’s hard to stay invested in a plot in which everything is so casually interconnected.” He implies that there’s nothing at stake in your narrative. Therefore, is there nothing at stake in P.T. Anderson’s interpretation of it? I’ll admit, yes, there’s something static about his cinematic interpretation of &lt;em&gt;Inherent Vice&lt;/em&gt;. But while the overarching narrative sometimes feels a bit inert, the individual scenes have their own velocity. As a series of comedy sketches, they are divine. The film is aligned with the approach you’ve taken throughout your career of dismantling the traditional structure of the novel: the parts are the whole and the sum doesn’t matter.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To make whatever sense there is to be made of this, Anderson takes a minor character from the book and makes her your stand-in: Sortilege appears, in the first frames of the film, almost as a ghost, double-exposed over the beachside landscape. As she reappears throughout the film, she communicates exclusively with Doc and is never acknowledged by any other characters onscreen. That enigmatic Pynchonian presence is transferred to her. She has the voice of a precocious little girl playing cool, a pre-teen reading aloud from one of your novels found on her parents bookcase, and her narration provides that aloof, absurdist, self-referential editorializing that your prose is known for. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Both yours and Anderson’s reputations are rooted in your technical proficiency (Anderson’s complex tracking shots, your complex plots), and your care with composition. Anderson shot this film in 35mm – just like he did with his last film, &lt;em&gt;The Master&lt;/em&gt; – and director of photography Robert Elswit should win some kind of award just for the way he shoots Eric Roberts’ face in the last act of the film. It’s a moment that reinforces that old actor’s adage that the one person on set you want to be friends with is the cinematographer. Roberts has about four minutes of screen time and has never been more compelling. Everything is dark, muddled in shadows. Even when Joaquin Phoenix, as paranoid private dick Larry “Doc” Sportello, is lounging around his sunny beachside pad, his face is overcast, only dimly visible. It’s perpetually evening in this film. Even in the middle of the afternoon.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You also share an infantile sense of humor. The movie, just like the book, is at its heart a comedy. It’s full of spit takes, double-takes, and startled yelps. There are some amazing bits of physical comedy: Josh Brolin sucking on frozen bananas, Martin Short tripping about with his pants around his ankles. But no one is better than Phoenix, who channels Peter Sellers: he’s a stoner Clouseau, tiptoeing through bedrooms, getting knocked over by cops while crossing the street, getting cracked on the head with a blackjack, half-turning, raising a finger as if to ask a question, and collapsing—all in one fluid movement. There’s nothing objectively funny about an angry cop ordering pancakes in Japanese, but I haven’t laughed harder in a theater all year (with one &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/1/6/no-the-trip-to-italy-is-the-best-film-of-2014.html&quot;&gt;important exception&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Inherent Vice&lt;/em&gt; occurs at the nadir of the counterculture the same way &lt;em&gt;Boogie Nights&lt;/em&gt; takes place at the death of the porn-on-film era (&lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cH0kOWNtLFo&quot;&gt;damn you, Floyd Gondoli!&lt;/a&gt;). This perhaps explains the current of melancholy that runs throughout. The good times are ending, flower power proven finite. Katherine Waterson (who plays the dame who kicks the whole thing off, in classic Spillane style) is the vessel for this sadness and fatigue. She’s the real star of the film. In her performance is all the earnestness that your body of work consciously despises, which makes Anderson’s vision of your scummy 70s underworld of cults and conspiracies several degrees more human. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yeah, none of it matters. Plot threads dangle, important characters disappear, knots remain unknotted. But Anderson gives it all just enough warmth to counteract the coldness of the joke that’s being played. And for that I’m sure you’re grateful. &lt;/p&gt;

				<title>The Guest</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Okay. I get it, now. It’s all starting to make sense.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For a long time, though, I didn’t understand. You left one of the &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt1606375/&quot;&gt;most popular television series&lt;/a&gt; in the English speaking world at the peak of its popularity to pursue other roles. But there was no blockbuster superhero flick on the horizon, no colorful supporting part in a Paul Thomas Anderson ensemble. Instead, your first post-Downton gig was the lead in a low-budget thriller that pays homage to low-budget thrillers. Which, forgive me, didn’t seem like the wisest career decision. Even Hugh Grant knew well enough to milk his stuttering English charm for a few more flicks before trying his hand as the star of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.imdb.com/title/tt0116259/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_25&quot;&gt;a Hollywood suspense film&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But it turns out that &lt;em&gt;The Guest&lt;/em&gt; is more than just a movie-geek trifle. And if you were looking to exorcise the elegant, befuddled specter of your Downton Abbey alter ego Matthew Crawley, there was no better role than this. As the mysterious stranger who shows up to pay his respects to the family of a fallen army comrade, you have established your place in the company of cinema’s all-time great tough guys. You, sir, are no Hugh Grant.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;The Guest&lt;/em&gt; might as well have been subtitled &lt;em&gt;A Series of Gratifying Revenge Fantasies&lt;/em&gt;. Throughout the film, schoolyard bullies are brutally punished, lecherous ex-boyfriends are publicly shamed, and professional rivals disappear under suspicious circumstances. But simply bringing to life juvenile daydreams of comeuppance doesn’t a great film make. And &lt;em&gt;The Guest&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;is&lt;/em&gt; a great film (one of 2014’s best, according to at least two &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/12/31/jared-youngs-top-films-of-2014.html&quot;&gt;highly-respected&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/12/31/c-redmonds-top-films-of-2014.html&quot;&gt;film critics&lt;/a&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of this greatness is in the film’s clever confounding of expectations. Director Adam Wingard achieves this by rooting the style and narrative in a familiar place: the world of cheap, violent videocassette thrillers (think early John Carpenter, or &lt;em&gt;The Stepfather&lt;/em&gt;). But as the film progresses, he begins to break the rules. Our assumptions are, every few minutes, recalibrated. Apprehension turns to attraction. Attraction turns to suspicion, then repulsion. And in the very last moments of the film, impossibly, that repulsion becomes admiration. It’s classic sleight-of-hand. It looks like he’s playing a familiar magic trick, but while you’re watching closely for wires and mirrors, you realize he’s pulling off something much grander.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s a difficult feat for any filmmaker. And an even more difficult feat for the actor who must embody all those subtle (and not-so-subtle) shifts. But both of you pull it off. Even the carefully-curated soundtrack is proof of Wingard’s movie-nerd bonafides: it gets the tone exactly right, all drum machine beats and ominous synth swells. The &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.myfonts.com/fonts/adobe/friz-quadrata/&quot;&gt;typeface&lt;/a&gt; of the titlecard, too.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But I’m making it sound like a &lt;em&gt;The Guest&lt;/em&gt; is some kind of esoteric metatextual experiment. It’s really just an excellent capital-M &lt;em&gt;movie&lt;/em&gt;, built from a series of excellent movie moments. All of which focus on your character. Ultimately it’s your performance that elevates &lt;em&gt;The Guest&lt;/em&gt;past the conventions of the genre. The uncompromising stare, those blazing eyes, that swagger, that smirk—in most films, all of that coolness would simply be in service to the star’s ego. But your seduction of the audience, here, is to a greater purpose. And somehow you pulled it off while wearing a hoodie and a crisp golf shirt.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Top Five</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;On a Hollywood film, there’s only one job that belongs &lt;em&gt;uniquely&lt;/em&gt; to the director: coaching the actors. Hair, make-up, costumes, set design, special effects, editing—pretty much every other responsibility is delegated to one degree or another. Even choosing camera angles and the look of a film can fall disproportionately on a good cinematographer’s shoulders (which is how they earn their reputations as the hardest working person on set). So when I saw you in the credits for &lt;em&gt;Top Five&lt;/em&gt;, it confirmed what I had suspected: Chris Rock can’t direct.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Normally, when you’ve been hired, it’s to train actors for a very specific – and often technically difficult – level of specificity, like hitting the Kennedy brother’s broken Boston cadence (like you did in &lt;em&gt;Thirteen Days),&lt;/em&gt; achieving a believable stutter (like you did in &lt;em&gt;The Green Mile)&lt;/em&gt;, or helping someone master a foreign accent or speak a second language (like you did with Jet Li in &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon 4&lt;/em&gt;). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In fact, it&amp;#39;s possible that &lt;em&gt;Lethal Weapon 4&lt;/em&gt; is where you met Rock. And maybe he kept you in mind for &lt;em&gt;Top Five&lt;/em&gt;. Or maybe he just learned from his first two films – &lt;em&gt;Head of State&lt;/em&gt; in 2003 and &lt;em&gt;I Think I Love My Wife&lt;/em&gt; in 2007, that he needed all the help he could get. I certainly won’t fault him,&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/12/29/unbroken.html&quot;&gt;or anyone&lt;/a&gt;, for stacking the deck in their favour. But in this case, it just makes the failure all the more inexcusable. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Let’s start with the acting. Chris Rock may or may not have actually suffered from alcoholism in his life, but, if so, he sure doesn’t know how to translate that into a believable performance. His deficiencies as a dramatic actor would usually have no bearing on his comedic delivery, but &lt;em&gt;Top Five&lt;/em&gt; isn’t just a straight-up comedy. It meanders with the overreaching ambition of Richard Linklater’s &lt;em&gt;Before&lt;/em&gt; series, yet tries to anchor its meandering with a conventional Hollywood plot—minus any of the necessary turns or emotional beats that might qualify the film as a proper drama (or even a dramedy). Much of this failure has to do with Rock’s own high-pitched, always in-on-the-joke delivery, which makes him more than ever feel like the Black Seinfeld (who, speaking of which, makes a very amusing out-of-character cameo). &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe that’s on you. I can’t imagine who else you were hired to help. Rosario Dawson is always great, and gives her performance more heart than the script does. Most of the other actors are simply playing variations of themselves, or characters we’re familiar with them playing. That, at least, allows for enjoyable bits scattered throughout the film. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But there are still too many scenes that drag on a little too long, a story structure that complicates instead of clarifies, and a title that’s as throw-away as many of the scenes. &lt;em&gt;Top Five&lt;/em&gt; can’t help but disappoint. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe next time, coach.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Taken 3</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Hello, old friend. As you know, I’m usually the most responsible of people. I rarely overindulge or miss deadlines. I am never late for work and feel strongly that something worth doing is worth doing well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;However.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;After having seen the trailer for &lt;em&gt;Taken 3&lt;/em&gt; I knew I was going to need some help. And you, sweet delicious nectar of the potato, were there for me. You helped me endure – and even enjoy – a savagely indifferent film that has, in this third installment, become a parody of itself. The &lt;em&gt;Taken&lt;/em&gt; franchise has now out-Verhoevened Verhoeven in its contempt for both genre and its audience. It isn’t even campy. It has surpassed camp and taken up residence in some critical space I wouldn’t be able to access were it not for you, my clear-hued, odorless companion.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;When my wife and I were ushered into the VIP theatre and placed our order (she had the Mac and Cheese bites, and I purchased a small river of you), I felt adequately prepared. And thank sweet heaven I was, because the next 109 minutes were filled with a kind of inanity that I can only describe as surreal. I &lt;em&gt;do&lt;/em&gt; remember Dougray Scott doing a hilarious Christopher Walken read of his character and &lt;em&gt;I do&lt;/em&gt; remember Liam Neeson killing any number of people who were trying to kill him. And, in between all that, &lt;em&gt;I do&lt;/em&gt; recall some stuff that looked like someone who was drunker than I was had shot it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Please believe me, I take this reviewing stuff seriously. I usually wouldn’t dream of you and I hooking up while I was trying to work. Normally I can also find a decent thing or two to say about a mediocre film. But &lt;em&gt;Taken 3&lt;/em&gt; is the apex of cinema as product. There is literally not a moment of suspense or cleverness in the entire film. And the only thing I enjoyed at all was Sarah’s sotto voce recapitulation of the Walkenesque stylings of Dougray Scott. In fact, the only thing that could have saved this film would have been a MST3K overdub.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And you, of course. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;You made it possible for me to find my way into the murky plot; something about Neeson’s character – the eminently skilled, at least in particular ways, Brian Mills – being framed for his ex’s murder (Famke Janssen manages to make her escape fairly early), and Mills’ pregnant daughter struggling to make sense of her mother’s murder and her father’s fugitive status. A circumstance which the film treats as if she had flunked a college course (or something equally inconvenient), but certainly not tragic. The whole film is so casually sloppy that I kept waiting for some meta plot turn; Neeson turning to the camera, giving us shit for wasting our time, then dropping the mic and walking off-screen.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That would have been awesome, actually. Unfortunately it only happened in my head. The rest of the film reminded me of the later works of Steven Seagal—the ones in which he’s so fat that he has to fight while sitting in a chair. When &lt;em&gt;Taken 3&lt;/em&gt; finally ended in the most flippant, casual way possible, you could hear the whole theatre snigger. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Oh I almost forgot: Forest Whitaker, in an attempt to lend some depth to his cartoonishly thin character, had an elastic band wrapped around his wrist. He would snap it every time he was frustrated by Neeson and his amazing capacity for escaping citywide manhunts while simultaneously leaving a conspicuous trail of corpses. That elastic was an anger management tool that they should have handed everyone as they entered the theatre.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That, and a quart of your lovely essence.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Sorry, The Lego Movie is the Best Film of 2014</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Fellow Critics,&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Sometimes it’s as much about &lt;em&gt;when&lt;/em&gt; you see the movie as it about the movie itself. Roger Ebert famously reviewed &lt;em&gt;Unforgiven&lt;/em&gt; twice: months after his initial two-star review, he revised it to a full-blown four out of four. He reasoned that when he first saw the film (which he would eventually decide was a masterpiece), he was too distracted by events in his own life; he wasn’t in the right frame of mind to address it beyond a superficial level. Cinema is patient, though. When you are ready, it will be waiting.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m fascinated by the changing relationship we can have with works of art. The way we’re pushed forward by life’s currents, and how that changes the way we relate to a thing that will forever remain unchanged. The films that have gained stature and meaning for me as I’ve gotten older – and, conversely, those that once seemed monumental and now look small and silly – are too numerous to list (I will provide two examples, though: &lt;em&gt;2001: A Space Odyssey&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Transformers: The Movie.&lt;/em&gt; I’ll let you guess which is which).&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I’m trying to say is, I reserve the right to look back at the version of me that wrote this and say: “What an idiot!”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But when I wandered into the theatre on that cold February morning with my 9 year-old son at my side, it was the ideal time for me to watch &lt;em&gt;The Lego Movie.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;To be honest, I’d taken the review assignment as much for him as anything else. I figured there’d be a few laughs. After all, watching the careers of directors Phil Lord and Christopher Miller as they moved from &lt;em&gt;Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;21 Jump Street&lt;/em&gt; to &lt;em&gt;The Lego Movie&lt;/em&gt; is a fascinating exercise in and of itself. But, really, I knew that bringing a dyed-in-the-wool Lego fanatic would be reward enough—even if I ended up disliking the movie. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Needless to say, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/2/7/the-lego-movie.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;that’s not what happened&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No, it wasn’t one of those &lt;em&gt;I-viewed-a-movie-through-the-eyes-of-a-child-and-saw-the-truth&lt;/em&gt; moments. I genuinely loved this film. From its attention to detail, to its (faux) stop-motion style, to the way today’s often &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/2/15/a-good-day-to-die-hard.html&quot;&gt;incomprehensible action cinematography&lt;/a&gt; becomes charming and fun when it’s literally reduced in scope. From a simple craft perspective, there’s a lot to love in &lt;em&gt;The Lego Movie&lt;/em&gt;. The film geek in me couldn’t get enough. The myriad pop culture cameos and crossovers might be one giant attempt at corporate synergy, but when synergy, well, &lt;em&gt;synergizes&lt;/em&gt; like this, it’s hard to resist.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But to really explain why &lt;em&gt;The Lego Movie&lt;/em&gt; made such an impression and stuck with me all the way to the end of the year, I need to discuss the ending. If you haven’t seen it yet, go ahead and do that first. I’ll be here when you get back.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s in the last act that the film evolved from extremely well-crafted mid-winter animated adventure into something sublime.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Back to February. For those of you unfamiliar with the particular joys of dealing with a too-large Lego collection under the control of a child’s active imagination, the content of most conversations involves the variations of the words “mess,” “disorder,” and “disaster.” In fact, I’d used those exact words about two days prior, capped off with the classic: “Why can’t you just keep these things together?”&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As &lt;em&gt;The Lego Movie&lt;/em&gt; made its deft shift from animation to live action, revealing the &lt;em&gt;deus&lt;/em&gt; behind its &lt;em&gt;machina&lt;/em&gt; (and providing a beautiful reason for all the flights of fancy and random encounters), I couldn’t help but see a bit of myself in Will Ferrell’s father character. I’m sure that’s not a unique reaction. I bet a lot of parents saw themselves in that scene. No, it wasn&amp;#39;t the concept itself that stayed with me. It was the moment Farrell addressed his son by name: Finn. Which happens to be &lt;em&gt;my&lt;/em&gt; son’s name. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That’s when I sort of lost it.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;And as I sank lower in my seat, I could only see it through the lens of our own relationship, and began to understand how something as seemingly inconsequential as a building toy could be the first of many wedges that weaken our bond. I walked out of the theatre wanting nothing more than to hug my boy and make sure he understood I would never be his own President Business.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Now, you’re probably thinking: “What, a movie happened to coincidently match your specific life circumstances, and that’s why it’s your favorite of the year?” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In short, yes.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But that’s the beauty of the movies. They speak to whatever version of us sees them. And sometimes that relationship is so in sync that we just have to give in. Am I saying &lt;em&gt;The Lego Movie&lt;/em&gt; is perfect? No. But then again it’s a bit of a running joke at DCAC that I refuse to bestow a perfect rating on anything, &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/1/7/wolf-of-wall-street.html&quot;&gt;no&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/1/14/her.html&quot;&gt;matter&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/1/18/zero-dark-thirty.html&quot;&gt;how much&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/11/16/lincoln.html&quot;&gt;I love&lt;/a&gt; &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/3/5/the-secret-world-of-arrietty.html&quot;&gt;it&lt;/a&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Maybe I want to leave a bit or room for that yet-to-exist movie that will be one step (or one half-star) better. Or maybe I’m saving that perfect rating for a future version of myself who is confident enough to bestow that label of perfection, even if his feelings change afterward. Who knows.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;What I do know is that when we got home from seeing &lt;em&gt;The Lego Movie,&lt;/em&gt; I walked into the basement and surveyed the field of demolished sets and half-completed monstrosities that had come from the mind of a person who still believes in the unlimited potential of the world, and I thought: &lt;em&gt;This...this is perfect.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Seriously, Birdman is the Best Film of 2014</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Fellow Critics&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Watching &lt;em&gt;Birdman (or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)&lt;/em&gt; is like watching a sparrow navigate the interior of a building. It is an agitating, beautiful, visceral experience. There is a tension inherent to something that lives one wrong choice away from utter disaster every second of its 119 minutes of life.&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Alejandro González Iñárritu’s fifth feature film is a construction overrun with masculine virtues. Brash and loud, egoistic, childish in its impetuousness, and more ambitious than it is prudent, you careen along its narrow corridors, barely allowed a moment to breathe. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is a film that lives or dies on its technical virtuosity, brilliant performances, and its foundation is a narrative that allows for multiple, but equally viable, interpretations. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;That it works on any level is as much luck as intention. And that is the wonder of it. To see that kind of ambitious overreach, to see a whole company of players risk a kind of &lt;em&gt;Death To Smoochy II&lt;/em&gt; (I’m talking specifically to Ed Norton here) and come out the other side is a rarity—especially these days.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We are living in a time where risk-averse bean counters have become cultural gatekeepers. So we often end up with the movie equivalent of pyramid building—overwrought structures that have no discernible value other than to make people crane their necks. But people will pay and pay and pay to stare at a monument to nothing simply because we are so easily amused. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;This kind of filmmaking—the Christopher Nolan-Joss Whedon-Michael Bay School, for lack of a better label—is a specific peeve of Iñárritu’s and something that both he and his characters hyperbolically reject as “cultural genocide”. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yet this film is anything but a scold, despite the amount of time and dialogue the characters spend trying to justify their art or condemn those that don’t understand it. There is a wonderful scene where Keaton’s character, Riggan Thomson, and the platonic ideal of a theatre critic, played by Lindsay Duncan, engage in a bar. Keaton gets up a head of steam and what follows is an eloquent, beautifully constructed monologue about the absolute ballsiness of getting on a stage and risking that most precious and fragile of human appendages, the ego. This is quickly followed by a terse description of how critics could well be the lowest form of life to ever crawl from the ooze. It is a beautiful, almost transcendent moment.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It is here that Duncan (an actress that &lt;em&gt;should&lt;/em&gt; get at least half of the roles that Meryl Streep ends up in) skewers both Riggan and his pretensions with one brief observation about the vast distance between his ambitions and his reality. This is the true beauty of the work; it continually expresses the paradox of how the whole is greater than the sum of its parts. How a facile, spiritually bereft man-child can somehow create a moment of beauty, an instant of real honesty, even as he continues to destroy himself and every significant relationship he has ever had. The fact that the apex of Riggan’s creative life, both critically and as an artist, is largely the result of a single, darkly pitched failure simply underlines that truth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are some obvious parallels to the lives of the principals involved and that is also more a truth than it is simply a narrative construction. Keaton and Norton’s career arcs are nothing new. The sell out and the unmanageable but god-touched &lt;em&gt;enfant terrible&lt;/em&gt; are well-worn archetypes but they exist as templates because they are so accurate to life. Iñárritu himself has been accused of flagrant pretensions and as a purveyor of “the theatre of the miserable”—accusations which he seems to accept and acknowledge as true. But he makes a strong case that those very negative attributes are as essential to the creative process as discipline, or talent, or even inspiration. &lt;em&gt;Birdman (or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)&lt;/em&gt; is the concrete example of that thesis. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Everything about it, from the faux continuous shot, to the merging of the surreal and hyperreal, even the expansive and talky script demarcate an ego that truly believes it has something useful to say to the world. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iñárritu requires a level of engagement that few directors dare ask of an audience. Because it is set in a world of magic realist physics its value is mediated by your ability and willingness to engage with its themes. The piece requires your active participation to function properly. And to add to Iñárritu’s presumption, the last five minutes of this film is essentially a cinematic Rorschach test—what you make of it says far more about you than anything else. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Iñárritu risks everything on his ability to draw you into this confusing, fragmented world and make you care enough about characters that are flawed in the most banal ways. Neither monsters nor saints, every character (with the serene exception of Amy Ryan as Riggan’s ex) is barely hanging on by their fingernails in a narrative that manages to speak to something larger than any one person’s sad little story. Instead of providing a cathartic dénouement, Iñárritu offers you something that is either profoundly tragic, starkly redemptive, or simply an end. It all depends on you.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For that and many other reasons: the score, the astonishing cinematography, even the bleak laughter it sometimes elicits, &lt;em&gt;Birdman&lt;/em&gt; &lt;em&gt;(or The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)&lt;/em&gt; should claim the title of best film of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>Actually, Wild is the Best Film of 2014</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Fellow Critics, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grudge Match&lt;/em&gt; was the last film I saw in 2013 and the first film I reviewed for Dear Cast and Crew. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/1/4/wild.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was the last film I saw in 2014, and the first film I reviewed in 2015. *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was more excited to see &lt;em&gt;Grudge Match&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’m a sucker for an underdog story, especially a boxing one, but what disappointed me most wasn’t the hackneyed narrative or the phoned-in performances (both of which I expected). &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/12/19/grudge-match.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grudge Match&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; was just so blatantly misogynistic and homophobic that it was almost satire. A dude-bro recruitment film. I left the theatre feeling cheated. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wild&lt;/em&gt; already had a strike against it when I heard that it had been adapted from an Oprah Book Club pick, a memoir by a woman who walked 1100 miles of the gruelling Pacific Crest Trail alone. I steeled myself for treacly sentimentality and faux-earnest narration over an Enya-heavy soundtrack. I apologized in advance to my sci-fi-loving husband who would much rather have been watching &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/11/10/interstellar.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Interstellar&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. But from the first few moments that Reese Witherspoon appeared onscreen, bleeding and swearing, I was captivated. Humbled, even.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Unlike my esteemed colleague Christopher, I did not see 200 films in 2014. I didn’t see 100. I doubt I even saw 50. This has less to do with the state of modern cinema and more to do with the fact that I &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; dislike going to the theatre unless I absolutely have to. I’m always the first member of the DCAC crew to volunteer to watch a screener from the comfort of my couch. Based on the paltry number of films I saw in 2014, it may not even be fair for me to weigh in on which one was the best. But I can make an argument for why &lt;em&gt;Wild&lt;/em&gt; was the most important. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I’ve spent almost fifteen years watching movies professionally, but rarely do I watch them for myself. Every once in a while a film manages to sneak past my critical gaze and move me, not just as a critic, but as an individual. &lt;em&gt;Children of Men&lt;/em&gt; and &lt;em&gt;Diving Bell and the Butterfly&lt;/em&gt; are some recent examples. &lt;em&gt;C.R.A.Z.Y.&lt;/em&gt;, as well. All of which feature male protagonists. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The last time a female-driven film touched me so profoundly was &lt;em&gt;Thelma &amp;amp; Louise&lt;/em&gt; in 1991. Is &lt;em&gt;Wild&lt;/em&gt; as good as &lt;em&gt;Thelma &amp;amp; Louise&lt;/em&gt;? Jean-Marc Vallée might be a better director than &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/12/12/exodus-gods-and-kings.html&quot;&gt;Ridley Scott&lt;/a&gt; is &lt;em&gt;now&lt;/em&gt;, but not better than he was in his prime. And, yes, timing is everything. &lt;em&gt;Thelma &amp;amp; Louise&lt;/em&gt; was the movie the 18 year-old me needed. For a young feminist and writer, its influence was undeniable. Thelma and Louise were thrust into a situation that required them to react quickly and violently; they became accidental poster girls for third-wave feminism and unwittingly ignited a cultural shitstorm. Critics called the film misandrist, the protagonists poor role models. &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,287998,00.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Time&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; accused &lt;em&gt;Thelma &amp;amp; Louise&lt;/em&gt; of being &amp;#39;&amp;#39;tapped into a wild-rushing subterranean stream of inchoate rage and deranged violence.&amp;#39;&amp;#39; They killed exactly one guy. A rapist. It always struck me odd that their contemporary male counterparts – John Rambo, John McClane, Riggs &amp;amp; Murtaugh – were never held to task for their collective quadruple-digit body counts. But hey, boys will be boys, amirite?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wild&lt;/em&gt; arrived at the end of a game-changing year for women. Jian Ghomeshi, Bill Cosby, and the #beenrapedneverreported hashtag. Ray and Janay Rice and the #whyistayed and #whyileft phenomenon. The &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b1XGPvbWn0A&quot;&gt;Hollaback catcall video&lt;/a&gt; and #yesallwomen. Gamergate. Regardless of personal opinion, there’s no denying that these events forced a dialogue that was long overdue. And yet a quick perusal of the comments section for any of these news stories (or sadly, even for the &lt;a href=&quot;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=tn2-GSqPyl0&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Wild&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; trailer) is a nasty reminder of just how far we need to go. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There persists a tangible &lt;a href=&quot;http://womenagainstfeminism.tumblr.com/&quot;&gt;resistance&lt;/a&gt; not just to the concept of feminism, but to the very word itself. I was pleasantly shocked when &lt;em&gt;Wild&lt;/em&gt;’s protagonist Cheryl Strayed is asked point blank if she is a feminist and she responds without hesitation in the affirmative. Alone on the trail, Cheryl experiences dangerous terrain, dehydration, rattlesnakes, and other potentially fatal circumstances—and yet her most terrifying encounter is with a man. Yes, this film is about overcoming odds, facing personal demons, and finding redemption. But it’s also about consent.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It matters that Cheryl’s choices are frustrating and make her difficult to like. She is the kind of heroine we need to see more of: &lt;em&gt;she’s interesting&lt;/em&gt;. She’s a former junkie. She’s promiscuous. She’s angry, funny, determined, intelligent, and deeply wounded without ever being tragic. She owns her mistakes. She has no regrets, and the only person she feels the need to apologize to is herself. It’s refreshing to see a powerful female lead that can be complicated and vulnerable without giving up her own agency.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But my response to &lt;em&gt;Wild&lt;/em&gt; is about more than just the simple fact that Cheryl is unapologetically feminist. It’s not merely a better-than-average chick-flick. It transcends genre because technically and tonally it’s a really, &lt;em&gt;really&lt;/em&gt; good film.  &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;On the page, it might seem pretty simple; no explosions, car chases, complicated CGI sequences, or hordes of extras. But too often these quiet stories of personal triumph get mired in maudlin cliché. Or worse, fall into the biopic trap of trying too hard to impose a clever framing device that encompasses and explains someone’s life, which more often than not results in weak, forgettable characterization. Vallée is one of the few directors assured enough to understand that his role is to be in service to the story. Maybe that’s why so many of his choices seem instinctual rather than contrived. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Vallée assembled a team that elevated this film beyond its &lt;em&gt;Eat, Pray, Love&lt;/em&gt; on a Mountain premise. Nick Hornby’s unadorned script, music supervisor Susan Jacob’s period-sensitive yet surprisingly original soundtrack, and Yves Belanger’s understated cinematography all work together to tell Cheryl’s story without polishing it to a sheen. Reese Witherspoon’s transformation is every bit as noteworthy as Jake Gyllenhaal’s in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/10/29/nightcrawler.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;Nightcrawler&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt;. Laura Dern’s performance as Cheryl’s mother is characteristically unaffected and heartbreakingly powerful. The dynamic of a daughter entering adulthood and questioning her mother’s life choices is rarely seen, let alone translated so succinctly. When Cheryl asks, “Does it bother you that I’m more sophisticated than you were at my age?” Dern’s reply is gutting: “That’s all I ever wanted for you, but I can’t say it doesn’t hurt sometimes.” &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Grudge Match&lt;/em&gt; insulted me as a viewer. But to be fair, it’s no more insulting than the countless cookie-cutter rom-coms starring Katherine Heigel or &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/4/29/the-other-woman.html&quot;&gt;Cameron Diaz&lt;/a&gt; (or Reese Witherspoon, for that matter), who unfailingly play successful (&lt;a href=&quot;http://www.newyorker.com/magazine/2011/10/03/flick-chicks&quot;&gt;but klutzy, always klutzy&lt;/a&gt;) women whose lives are only fulfilled when they find a man (not to be confused with their action movie counterparts: the buxom, ass-kicking, but one-dimensional “&lt;a href=&quot;https://thedissolve.com/features/exposition/618-were-losing-all-our-strong-female-characters-to-tr/&quot;&gt;Strong Female Characters&lt;/a&gt;” designed to placate female audiences without alienating male viewers). What’s revolutionary about &lt;em&gt;Wild&lt;/em&gt; is how it breaks those stereotypes without really trying. Cheryl is a college drop-out, raised below the poverty line, who completes her journey and is left with no money, no job, no home, and no man. That’s her happy ending. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Feminism is just one of many themes in &lt;em&gt;Wild&lt;/em&gt;, and it’s not the most important. When a story is this compelling, the gender of the protagonist becomes irrelevant. Films as thoughtfully crafted as &lt;em&gt;Wild&lt;/em&gt; have the ability to resonate with more than just their target demo. If that’s not equality, I don’t know what is.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I had to wait a year, but I finally got to see that underdog film about a fighter who overcomes the odds. I just hope I don’t have to wait another 24 years to see the next one.&lt;/p&gt;

				<title>No, The Trip To Italy is the Best Film of 2014</title>
				<description>&lt;p&gt;Dear Fellow Critics, &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;*&lt;em&gt;As you know, picking a best film of the year is a special sort of ethical dilemma. Your selection doesn’t just define your aesthetic tastes, but who you are as a person at that particular moment in time (if I was writing this essay in 1996, you’d be hearing all about the hyperkinetic genius of Michael Bay’s &lt;em&gt;The Rock&lt;/em&gt;). *&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you take the process of annointing a “best film” seriously (and you half-should), you have to make some important decisions about how you approach the act of criticism itself. Is the best film your favorite film? The film that you enjoyed the most, that seemed to speak most directly to your experience, your worldview, your personal tastes? Or is it the film that, in some explicit and objective way, best exemplifies the potential of cinema as an art form? Something empirically superior? If you’re lucky, you’ve seen a film that represents some amalgamation of those two noble goals. Otherwise, you’re making an objective judgment of something inextricably subjective.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Ultimately, how you choose your favorites says a lot about how you watch films. I have no pretensions of being an exhaustive, scholarly filmgoer (not like I did back in 1996). Frankly, I lack &lt;a href=&quot;https://film500.wordpress.com/&quot;&gt;the Lou Bloom-like dedication of some people&lt;/a&gt;. I must rely on my instincts, and my instincts are guided by that fundamental principle of art: to alter the way we see the world. In 2014, there &lt;em&gt;was&lt;/em&gt; a film that made me reconsider the way I see the world, the way I live my life, and the way I distinguish between Welsh and Scottish James Bonds. And that film was Michael Winterbottom’s &lt;em&gt;The Trip to Italy&lt;/em&gt;. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Much of what affected me about the film has to do with my fond feelings for the first installment: Coogan and Brydon cruising through Northern England, bickering, debating, the former perpetually annoyed, that latter perpetually eager. Coogan has a series of affairs, but can never quite find the contentment that Brydon and his young family possess. Brydon, on the other hand, doesn’t have Coogan’s ambitions, and has achieved only a fraction of his success. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Here, in the sequel, Coogan is a bit more stable (he has a regular TV gig), and Brydon’s ambitions have expanded (he’s auditioning for a role in a Michael Mann film). Which is perhaps what makes &lt;em&gt;The Trip To Italy&lt;/em&gt; so fascinating to me. It’s an experiment in character building; take two established characters, switch their circumstances, stand back and see how they react. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Coogan and Brydon are playing versions of themselves, sure, but it’s not quite the same trick that the gang in &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/6/12/this-is-the-end.html&quot;&gt;&lt;em&gt;This Is The End&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/a&gt; plays. These colorful caricatures are sketched against a plain white background. The semi-documentary style employed by Winterbottom is more than just the same stylistic conceit adopted by modern sitcoms and found footage flicks. It manages to fix the characters in a real and recognizable world while also amplifying their comedic eccentricities. The way the story resolves – by not quite resolving at all – is indicative of the film’s non-traditional narrative structure. The sweet conclusion of Coogan’s paternal about-face, and the ambiguity of how Brydon will deal with his compromised morals, is a perfect ending, and deeply affecting to anyone who has gained an affinity for these two men over the course of two films. &lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In the ruins of Pompeii, when Coogan – who throughout both films demonstrates a spiritual allergy to notions of death and mortality – gets his hackles up at Brydon’s fun-making at the expense of a thousand year-old corpse is both funny and poignant and speaks simply to big ideas of impermanence and empathy. Sure, those are the same big ideas that other important films of 2014 addressed. But no other film addressed them with such subversive ease.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Yes, the formula is simple. Two actors playing lightly fictionalized version of themselves, let loose to improvise about squabbling movie stars and obscure British chat show hosts. Some might argue that in a year of &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/8/5/boyhood.html&quot;&gt;decades-in-the-making passion projects&lt;/a&gt; and &lt;a href=&quot;http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/1/5/yes-nightcrawler-is-the-best-film-of-2014.html&quot;&gt;dark dissertations on the state of the American soul&lt;/a&gt; a film about two blokes conversing over dinner and wine is too unambitious, too ordinary to be the best film of the year. But no one discounts the power of a film like &lt;em&gt;My Dinner With Andre&lt;/em&gt; for modesty of scope. Nor should you discount &lt;em&gt;The Trip To Italy&lt;/em&gt;, which is the best (aka. my favorite) film of 2014.&lt;/p&gt;
