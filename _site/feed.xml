				<title> Feature: The Value of a Veteran Filmmaker</title>
				<description>
  				<![CDATA[

  				<p>Dear Freshman Filmmakers, <br />
  				1985 was the hardest year of my life, and one movie helped me get through it. One gloriously bad movie that celebrates its 30th anniversary this year. That movie is <em>Rocky IV</em>.p>

				<title>Review: Big Game</title>

  				<p>Dear Jalmari Helander, Writer/Director, <br />
  				<p>I didn’t like your movie <em>Big Game</em> very much, but my real argument with you is less about the quality of your particular film and more to do with a larger issue.</p>

				<title>Review: Terminator: Genysis</title>
				<description>
  				<![CDATA[
  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/terminator-genysis.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear Ronna Kress, Casting, <br />
  				<p>It would be unfair to place the responsibility for the fiasco that is <em>Terminator: Genisys</em> entirely at your feet. It’s a film whose shortcomings are so varied, so composite, that they defy easy categorization. The special effects are degenerative—somehow less thrilling, less real, than they were twenty-three (!) years ago in <em>Terminator 2: Judgment Day.</em> The script unfolds like something the producers acquired through Fiverr—it has all the nuance and surprise of a crowdsourced piece of fan fiction. The production feels small-scale, constrained, cheap. Even the music – which occasionally pays tribute to Brad Feidel’s clamorous carillon theme – is so vacuous and forgettable that the film may as well have been scored by radio static. </p>

				<title>Review: Magic Mike XXL</title>

  				<p>Dear Jada-Pinkett Smith, Actress, <br />
  				<p>You&#39;d think a movie like <em>Magic Mike XXL</em> would be the ultimate platform for misogynistic boasting, but it was the complete opposite thanks largely to you.</p>

				<title>Review: Ted 2</title>
				<description>
  				<![CDATA[
  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/ted-2.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear Hasbro, Villain, <br />
  				<p>When kids play with one of your Nerf toys, or adults sit down with your classic board game Clue, their goal is to turn off part of their brains and just enjoy themselves for an hour or two. The same is true of stupid comedies. Maybe this is why it makes sense that you’re a part of the stoner buddy-movie sequel <em>Ted 2</em>. Who would know better than you that sometimes people just want to have fun without searching for some deeper purpose? And yet, surprisingly, there are moments when <em>Ted 2</em> manages to do both.</p>

  				<p>Dear Steve Coogan, Actor, <br />
  				<p>This will come as no surprise to you, but you don’t actually appear in this movie. I’m not going to let that stop me from wishing you did.</p>

				<title>Review: Inside Out</title>
				<description>
  				<![CDATA[
  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/inside-out.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear Pete Docter, Co-Screenwriter, <br />
  				<p>You did a lot more than write the screenplay for <em>Inside Out</em>. Along with Ronaldo Del Carmen you also developed the original story and co-directed it. But I want to talk about how <em>Inside Out</em> is structured as a story, so “Co-screenwriter” is going to have to do for now.</p>

				<title>Review: Dope</title>
				<description>
  				<![CDATA[
  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/dope.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear McGuffin, Plot Mechanism, <br />
  				<p><em>Dope</em> is as much a cultural artifact as it is a story. An artifact because it often only makes sense in relationship to the films that it depends on to first inform, and prop up, its central premise—movies like <em>Juice</em>, <em>Boys N’ The Hood</em> and especially <em>Menace II Society.</em></p>
