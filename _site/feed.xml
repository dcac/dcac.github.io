  				<p>Dear Comedy Fans, <br />
  				<p>Making a video about the greatest comedies of all time is serious stuff. Well, we took it seriously, anyway. </p>

<p>This is the second instalment in our <strong>Greatest Movies A-Z</strong> series with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg">WatchMojo</a>, and it might have been the hardest of all. As tempting as it is to just stick to Will Farrell movies that make us laugh, we had the whole history of cinema to contend with. A rich, hilarious history which we hope this video serves as a nice reminder. Enjoy. </p>

<iframe width="624" height="351" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1iDnJOq_5yo?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>Again, we gave ourselves some guidelines:</p>

<ol>
<li>One film per letter</li>
<li>Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)</li>
<li>Final list should encapsulate the genre</li>
</ol>

<p>The last rule dictated a lot of our hardest decisions. Sometimes you have to go with beloved movies even if you don’t personally love them (looking at you, <em>Caddyshack</em>). </p>

<p>So here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission.</p>

<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM COMEDY A-Z</p>

<p>Now that this first video is out, here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission. </p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-comedy/top-decade.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>TOP DECADE: 1980s</strong><br />
        The 1980s have the most films on the list, suggesting some generational bias. The 70s and 90s are also well represented. The last 20 years have it rough: there’s not a single movie here from the 2010s. They just don’t make ‘em like they used to! And by that, we mean in the 20s and 30s (it’s not nostalgia - those movies we included are <em>still</em> great).
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-comedy/hardest-letter.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>HARDEST LETTER: G</strong><br />
        G, didn’t expect that! If a Charlie Chaplin vs Buster Keaton face-off wasn’t enough (<em>The Great Dictator</em> vs <em>The General</em>), what about the 1-2 punch of Bill Murray’s all-time classics <em>Groundhog Day</em> and <em>Ghostbusters</em>? Or maybe we meet halfway in the timeline with <em>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</em>? Instead, we played some politics, giving Keaton the G film and pushing <em>Groundhog Day</em> to another genre, and having Marilyn Monroe “settle” for the still pitch perfect comedy <em>Some Like it Hot</em>. <em>Ghostbusters</em> just didn’t make the call of a pure comedy - it’s so much more.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Runner-up: A</strong>. <em>Anchorman</em> vs <em>Ace Ventura</em> vs <em>Austin Powers</em> - come on!<br />
        <br />
        <strong>2nd Runner-up: B.</strong> <em>Blazing Saddles</em> vs <em>The Big Lebowski</em> vs _Bridesmaids_… see why we said this genre was the hardest??</p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-comedy/cheated-out.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>Lost in America</em></strong><br />
        It’s a Criterion Collection comedy (which is pretty rare), and just a hell of a funny ride. But the video was getting a little bro-centric. Even though Reese Witherspoon double dips with <em>Election</em>, <em>Legally Blonde</em> was just too big and beloved not to recognize.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-comedy/best-battle.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>Wayne’s World</em> <strong>vs</strong> <em>What’s Up, Doc?</em></strong><br />
        Wayne and Garth would probably claim they aren’t worthy of taking out screen queen Barbara Streisand in <em>What’s Up, Doc?</em>, but _Wayne’s World_really holds up. Still, we banged our heads against the wall for a while, then just went with our gut. Asphinctersayswhat?
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin:4rem 0;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-comedy/special-consideration.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>Dumb and Dumber</em>r</strong><br />
        You’re either thinking <em>hell yes!</em> this movie made the cut, or <em>what the hell</em>? The film snob in us definitely fought for <em>Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</em>. The film historian part of our brain mounted a solid argument for the Marx Brothers’ <em>Duck Soup</em>. But at the risk of our pets losing their heads, we just had to respect the biggest comedy star of the 90s in one of the dumbest, funniest movies of a generation
    </p>

<p>Think your list would be better? More balanced? Less heart-breaking? Let us know.</p>

				<title> Feature: Horror Movies: A-Z</title>
				<description>
  				<![CDATA[
  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/a-z-horror.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear Horror Fans, <br />
  				<p>You know what’s really scary? Committing to a list of the all-time best horror films. </p>

<p>As the first video in our new Greatest Movies A-Z series with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg">WatchMojo</a>, we knew it wouldn’t be easy. That doesn’t mean we knew it would be so hard. But here it is:</p>

<iframe width="624" height="351" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1iDnJOq_5yo?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

<p>As you can see, we gave ourselves some guidelines:</p>

<ol>
<li>One film per letter</li>
<li>Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)</li>
<li>Final list should encapsulate the genre</li>
</ol>

<p>The last rule dictated a lot of our hardest decisions. And we’re confident with where we ended up - especially after a last minute change to replace <em>Killer Klowns from Outer Space</em> with <em>King Kong</em>. </p>

<p>(Seriously. We almost forgot <em>King Kong</em> was a horror movie. That would have gotten ugly).</p>

<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM HORROR A-Z</p>

<p>Now that this first video is out, here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission. </p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-horror/top-decade.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>TOP DECADE: 1970s</strong><br />
        Nine of our choices come from the 70s. Every one of them has a sequel and/or remake. The decade really set the template for modern horror. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-horror/hardest-letter.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>HARDEST LETTER: P</strong><br />
        <em>Paranormal Activity</em>. <em>Poltergeist</em>. <em>The Purge<em>. </em>Pet Sematary</em>.  All extremely successful and important to the genre, but they ultimately have to bow down to the mother of mainstream horror: <em>Psycho</em>.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-horror/cheated-out.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>Alien</em></strong><br />
        Is <em>Alien</em> a horror movie? Sure. But it fit better in another genre, so we didn’t even consider it here. Don’t worry, we can hear you scream. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-horror/best-battle.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>Scream</em> vs <em>The Shining</em></strong><br />
        If you think we’re crazy for not going with Kubrick, trust me: we get it. <em>The Shining</em> is a bona fide classic, and has had a real cultural resurgence since <em>Room 237</em>, <em>Ready Player One</em>, and <em>Doctor Sleep</em>. But <em>Scream</em> single-handedly rejuvenated the horror genre in the mid 90s. It spawned three sequels, countless imitators, and even a spoof series (<em>Scary Movie</em>) that got all the way to a fifth instalment. Not to mention how the original <em>Scream</em> still totally slaps as a horror movie. The best argument against it might be that we already have a Wes Craven film in <em>Nightmare on Elm Street</em>. But like <em>Scream</em>, we just had to play with the rules here.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin:4rem 0;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-horror/special-consideration.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>The Wizard of Gore</em></strong><br />
        Is it really better than <em>The Witch</em>? Probably not, but we had to throw some love at the buckets-of-blood king Herschell Gordon Lewis. Helped us round out the style of horror films on the list, too.

				<title>Review: The Invisible Man</title>
				<description>
  				<![CDATA[
  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/the-invisible-man.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear Harry Dakanalis, Motion Control Supervisor, <br />
  				<p>No one obsesses over someone’s invisible movements as much as you do. It’s your job to anticipate where someone could be and remember all their previous steps in order to see the full picture, even when others can’t. All made possible by some fancy new cameras.</p>

<p>Maybe Elisabeth Moss was stalking <em>you</em> in preparation for this role.  </p>

<p>Moss’s character in <em>The Invisible Man</em> is the victim of an abusive ex-boyfriend who gets inside her head, and eventually, her bedroom, without anyone else understanding how he could be so ever-present in her life. This is a Blumhouse thriller, not a purely psychological drama, so the villain is also a world-leading optics pioneer capable of such (literal) invisible stalking. But science is the last thing on writer and director Leigh Whanell’s mind. He made a genre film with an agenda. Basically, <em>It Follows</em> so <em>Get Out</em> of <em>A Quiet Place</em>. And <em>The Invisible Man</em> actually belongs in the conversation with those titans of new wave horror. </p>

<p>While you were tracking technical details, making sure that shots stitch together and track character movement, Whanell’s script has its sights set on the big picture. As a result, <em>The Invisible Man</em> is the first truly great film sprung from the #MeToo movement (apologies to <em>Bombshell</em>, <em>The Assistant</em>, <em>Support the Girls</em>, et al.). It delivers all the visceral suspense and thrills one expects from this type of outing, with a healthy dose of the female glare (what I’ll call the distrustful reaction to the infamous “male gaze”). By locking the audience&#39;s perspective to that of the victim, we experience first-person terror that feels miles apart from the pervy voyeur-o-vision we’ve come to expect from <em>Hollow Man</em> or the Translucent anti-superhero from “The Boys” TV series. It’s not just refreshing in a politically woke sense, it’s actually more effective as a film.</p>

<p>Much to your delight, I&#39;m sure, (and mine) the film isn’t trying to impress anyone with a floating fedora and sunglasses. Enough is withheld visually to almost believe, for a while, that maybe Moss’s character is going over the deep end, paranoid without real justification. The title of the film, of course, vindicates her from the start, but Whanell doesn’t let that prevent us from experiencing some skepticism ourselves as she seems to unravel. Until, of course, the shark comes out of the water and she has to face the terror head on.</p>

<p>In fact, the final act of the film proves as adept of an accomplishment in action filmmaking as the early part of the film is patient and deceptive with negative space. This transition in filmmaking styles doesn’t seem like it should work, but in practice it is wildly effective. I guess sometimes you just have to see to believe.</p>

				<title> Feature: Face it, The Last Black Man in San Francisco is the Best Film of 2019</title>

  				<p>Dear Fellow Critics, <br />
  				<p>If aliens were to come across a random list of everyone’s favourite films of 2019, they’d see a solid run-down of predictable awards season fare - a good chunk of which might make them think, “Wow, these Earthlings sure love their normalizing takes on very bad/dumb men,” BUT I digress. </p>

<p>It’s not that the titles buzzing on everyone’s lips aren’t good – I liked most of them a lot. However, for me, 2019 at the movies was good, but not knock-my-socks-off good; solid entertainment, but not worth all the hype. And yes, hard eye roll to all the giddy adulation for films that bend over backwards to explain why shitty, dangerous men are shitty and dangerous and why we should feel sorry for them, but make no actual point beyond that. ANYWAY.</p>

<p>Enough about Hollywood and its dumb men. To talk about <em>my</em> favourite film of 2019, we’re going to have to venture outside the Kingdom of Whitemaleia. I’m happy to finally have a chance to talk about Joe Talbot’s <em>The Last Black Man in San Francisco</em>, the only thing I saw last year that was still in my head two days later. I was not expecting a film about two black men struggling with issues surrounding poverty, displacement, and belonging to be the most relatable film I saw all year, but that is exactly why it’s at the top of my list. </p>

<p>I visited San Francisco once, many years ago. I had a fun few days, but didn’t see or do much beyond the usual touristy stuff. I certainly never saw anything of Jimmie and Mont’s San Francisco, and probably missed a lot of the film’s ‘inside’ jokes and references that would resonate with San Franciscan audiences, so I was surprised at how easily and deeply I connected with the story and characters. And it’s not just because, as a Torontonian, I can relate to real estate panic and a looming sense of displacement deep down into my toes. From city to city, as housing crises keep getting worse, conversations about affordability and belonging are often clumsy and vicious, dominated by the loudest and meanest among us. A film like <em>The Last Black Man…</em> invites us to think a little deeper on belonging and the notion of selfhood, and how it is tied to our concept of home and place. It explores the different ways in which we say, “I belong here;” for people like Jimmie, it’s about owning physical space; for others, like Mont, belonging is established and emphasized in the stories and written records of our experiences in and of a place. </p>

<p>The great thing about <em>The Last Black Man…</em> is that, with so much going on, Talbot deftly maintains a perfect balance between pathos and humour. The narrative gets deeply political at times, but this is not the type of film that will inspire outrage. It offers no solutions or suggestions regarding displacement, and arguably doesn’t even come down as hard on gentrification as one might expect. It raises questions around the concept of belonging, but doesn’t leave you too unsettled by the end. I keep coming back to <em>The Last Black Man…</em> in my head not just because I can relate to the story, but also because of its many small, perfect moments - certain shots, or numbers on the soundtrack that randomly make me smile when I remember them. It also earns major bonus points for providing respite from the impotent male rage that practically drenched big and small screens all damn year. Seriously, here’s to privileged dudes being a little less off their faces on their persecution complexes in 2020 but probably not because who are we even kidding. </p>

				<title>Review: 1917</title>
				<description>
  				<![CDATA[
  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/1917.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear Lee Smith, Editor, <br />
  				<p>Congratulations on a job well done in Sam Mendes’ <em>1917</em>, or <em>WWI: First Person Shooter</em>. I’m not being snarky, it really is such a great film. Much has been made of Mendes’ script (co-written with Krysty Wilson-Cairns), based on the wartime experiences of his own grandfather. However, while it is a good story, your editing and Roger Deakins’ cinematography is arguably the main draw. </p>

<p>The cinematography and editing that make the film look like one long take are rightly at the forefront of the conversation on <em>1917</em>. ‘Invisible editing’ on such a massive scale is undoubtedly difficult to pull off, and you make it look – well, seamless. Quite honestly, I was more into the visual and stylistic wizardry on display than the narrative. The story is a very basic hero’s quest, and there is very little meaty plot beyond that. There is also very little time devoted to character development, but then I’ve never really considered that to be a cornerstone of a war film, where I’d argue the general rule is not to get too attached to anyone onscreen.</p>

<p>And yet, I have heard and read some criticism that <em>1917</em> is ‘too much like a video game’, and that it suffers from a lack of time spent with the characters. I’d argue that both these things actually make it a stronger film. <em>1917</em> is more of an experience than a story, and setting the protagonist up to move through his environment as though playing through a first-person shooter actually works really well. Character development is contained to brief ‘cut scenes’, but there are still plenty of very powerful, moving moments in between all the shooting and explosions.</p>

<p>I can understand how some viewers might have felt a little stiffed; the trailer for the film spotlights a roster of some of the biggest British movie stars out there, making it seem like they will each have significant screen time. In fact, each of them is barely on screen for two minutes, and I found that cheeky and hilarious. Dangling Benedict Cumberbatch and Colin Firth in front of my nose only to have them utter three lines and disappear into the trenches is a pretty baller move – although a few more minutes of Andrew Scott would have earned you the extra 0.5 to make this a 5-star review. Just saying. </p>

<p>I usually have a tough time with war films because my brain tends to click off beyond a certain point of unrelenting noise and visual chaos, but I found <em>1917</em> to be much easier viewing. Your pacing achieves a balance between kaboom and quiet that allows full appreciation for the most intensely violent moments, but also the opportunity to regroup and absorb the progression of the narrative, while still keeping the viewer engaged and moving along with our hero from one level – sorry, <em>scene</em> – to the next. </p>

				<title> Feature: Admit It, Parasite is the Best Film of 2019</title>
				<description>
  				<![CDATA[
  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/admit-it-parasite-is-the-best-film-of-2019.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear Fellow Critics, <br />
  				<p>Like the bossman Christopher said in his opening line for why <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2020/1/13/screw-it-jallikattu-is-the-best-film-of-2019.html"><em>Jallikattu</em></a> is the best film of 2019, “We all know putting a film at the top of your personal list has more to do with activism than criticism.”</p>

<p>And he’s right.</p>

<p>My nomination for <em>Parasite</em> as the best film of 2019 is heavily driven by all the things that make a movie great (acting, set design, cinematography, themes, etc.). But, the <em>real</em> reason is far greater than mere technical merit. It’s activism embodied.</p>

<p>Whether you prefer <em>Jallikattu,</em> or <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2020/1/22/embrace-it-little-women-is-the-best-film-of-2019.html"><em>Little Women</em></a>, or <em>Six Underground</em> (I respect your decision, <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/writers/dig/">Di</a>)—it doesn’t matter. <em>Parasite</em> doesn’t have to be your favourite movie of 2019 but it deserves to be.</p>

<p>Why?</p>

<p>Well, in case you didn’t notice, people fought about everything in 2019. Flame wars have existed since online comment sections were a thing, but I feel like 2019 was the year where every minutiae was a hill to die on. The film community was especially vocal with battle lines being drawn over topics like:</p>

<p>“There are no more original stories…”</p>

<p>“Movies are too predictable nowadays...”</p>

<p>“Independent theatres are dying…”</p>

<p>“There aren’t enough minority-driven narratives…”</p>

<p>Et cetera, et cetera.</p>

<p>The simple act of watching a movie has become volatile and it sucks, both as a viewer and a critic—and that’s where <em>Parasite</em> comes in.</p>

<p>Despite what the name suggests, <em>Parasite</em> isn’t an infection—it’s the cure. It’s the cure to petty squabbles, blockbuster fatigue, arthouse segregation, adaption frenzy, and so much more.</p>

<p><em>Parasite</em> lives to subvert expectations. It takes what we think we know about the state of cinema and challenges it through sheer, impeccable craftsmanship.</p>

<p><strong>“There are no more original stories…”</strong></p>

<p><em>Parasite</em> is a completely original story. It’s not based off a book or a comic nor is it an adaption of an existing film/TV show. It’s not a retelling of a historical event or a biography about a key figure. The only inspiration comes from Director <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/entertainment/archive/2019/10/bong-joon-ho-parasite-interview/600007/">Bong-Joon Ho’s own experience</a> as a tutor for a rich family. It’s the type of campfire storytelling audiences have been craving for years. A simple life experience which sparked an idea which came to fruition in the form of a feature-length film.</p>

<p>It’s inspiring when you think about it. What stories do we have that can grow into something more? It’s silly to think that anyone can be a master filmmaker like Bong-Joon Ho just because they spent a summer as a lifeguard but if creating stories is your passion, take <em>Parasite</em> as an inspiration that your story is unique and worth telling.</p>

<p><strong>“Movies are too predictable nowadays...”</strong></p>

<p>The recurring theme in every <em>Parasite</em> review is how unpredictable the movie is. It’s arguably the biggest selling point and for good reason. <em>Parasite</em>’s unpredictability doesn’t come from a shocking twist ending or a misdirection. It comes from its unique ability to jump from one genre to another in such a seamless fashion, it feels organic. How does a film start off as a family comedy, transition into a heist thriller, plunge into a horror, rope in elements of a disaster flick, and then come out the other side as a poignant, somber drama?</p>

<p>The answer? I don’t know! For all intents and purposes, a movie that swaps genres to this extent clearly has narrative issues. Yet, in the hands of Bong-Joon Ho, the chaos is wrangled into submission. Like a herder dog rounding sheep back into their pen, <em>Parasite</em> lives to establish order from disarray. </p>

<p>As someone who watches his fair share of movies, I walked into <em>Parasite</em> with a chip on my shoulder. My arrogance thought it could figure out the Palme d&#39;Or-winning hype train before the credits rolled. All I can say is, I have never been so happy to be humbled in my life. Any inkling I had about where the plot was going was a dead-end. After a while, I gave up guessing and let myself be consumed by this weird, wonderful film.</p>

<p><strong>“Independent theatres are dying…”</strong></p>

<p>There is no denying, <a href="https://variety.com/2019/film/features/small-theaters-exhibitors-movie-business-1203170700/">independent theatres are closing</a> in cities around the world. There are a number of factors in play; large chains, streaming, a lack of marketing and promotion. It’s sad but once again, here comes <em>Parasite</em> to instill hope. Anytime I’ve been to a screening at an independent theatre, I can walk in five minutes before showtime and find a seat, no problem. In <em>Parasite</em>’s case, I had to wait in a line that stretched far outside the main entrance. Then, I had to grab one of the last seats available in the front-most row. Had I arrived 10 minutes later or grabbed popcorn before finding a seat, I would have been turned around at the gate.</p>

<p>Not only was the theatre full, it was teeming with a diverse crowd of different ages, races, and genders coming together to watch a South Korean film with subtitles. You have to admit, that line sounds like a pipe dream in 2019. It sounds like the logline for an Oscar bait film itself.</p>

<p>Movies have target audiences and there is nothing wrong with that. Everyone deserves a form of entertainment they can call their own. Yet, it’s the mass appeal of a foreign, indie darling that is truly shocking.</p>

<p>To quote the top YouTube comment in <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7TtC5JKip00">this video</a>, “When was the last time a foreign director came on a late night show to promote his movie? That’s how big it is.”</p>

<p>Big indeed. That video, if you didn’t click the link, is Bong-Joon Ho and his talented interpreter promoting <em>Parasite</em> on The Tonight Show with Jimmy Fallon, the epicenter of mainstream blockbuster media in the states. Reminds me of another <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D_nyuB8GbM8">South Korean phenomenon</a> that forced its way onto America’s main stage through sheer hype.</p>

<p><strong>“There aren’t enough minority-driven narratives…”</strong></p>

<p>Which brings me to the most sensitive of arguments plaguing Hollywood in 2019...death to the straight, white man!</p>

<p>This point riles me up because I am afraid that <em>Parasite</em> will lose out at the Oscars to self-indulgent rallying cries like <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2019/7/30/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood.html"><em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em></a> or <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2019/11/15/the-irishman.html"><em>The Irishman</em></a> that serve to stroke the egos of older Academy voters rather than create content that is new, refreshing, and worthy of praise…but I digress.</p>

<p>I think I’ve mentioned a few times that <em>Parasite</em> originates from South Korea but there is another aspect about the film that doesn’t get the recognition it deserves. <em>Parasite</em> is virtually split down the middle in male and female representation. For every male actor, there is a female counterpart who carries equal weight to the overall story.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm6476224/?ref_=tt_cl_t5">So-dam Park</a> is by far the craftiest of the bunch. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm4525883/?ref_=tt_cl_t7">Hye-jin Jang</a> is the muscle. <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm7553003/?ref_=tt_cl_t6">Jeong-eun Lee</a> turns the tide and <a href="https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1856097/?ref_=tt_cl_t3">Yeo-jeong Jo</a> is the pillar.</p>

<p>Like Bong-Joon Ho said when accepting his award for Best Foreign Language Film at the Golden Globes, “Once you overcome the one-inch-tall barrier of subtitles, you will be introduced to so many more amazing films.”</p>

<p>If I learned anything about film in 2019, it was that cinema is currently going through a transformation at the moment. It’s evolving to cater to a new generation which is making older ones feel isolated and forgotten and newer ones attacked for liking what they like. There has been a lot of commotion, discord, and negative energy. But, if there is a film in 2019 that bridges the divide between old and new, shatters preconceived notions of what is or isn’t happening to cinema, and operates on its own wavelength, you better believe it’s <em>Parasite.</em></p>

				<title> Feature: Embrace It, Little Women is the Best Film of 2019</title>
				<description>
  				<![CDATA[
  				<img src="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/assets/img/posts/thumb-600/embrace-it-little-women-is-the-best-film-of-2019.jpg" />
  				<p>Dear Fellow Critics, <br />
  				<p>“Little boys like shootouts and car chases, but real men like <em>Little Women</em>.”</p>

<p>Tracey Letts said this in a recent <a href="https://www.gq.com/story/tracy-letts-little-women-essay">GQ essay</a>, and while my list of favourite films from this past year includes at least one film that is essentially nothing but shootouts and car chases, it sits far behind the one I loved the most: Greta Gerwig’s <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2020/1/10/little-women.html">ingenious, subversive, joyous adaptation of <em>Little Women</em>. </a> </p>

<p>Of the good movies I saw this year, <em>Little Women</em> was the one that stayed in my head the longest, and seemed, in its lingering afterglow, to satisfy all the things I hope for in a movie: to be transported, and immersed, and surprised; to laugh, to weep; to be worried, to be relieved; to appreciate, from the outside, the impeccable craft, and to live on the inside as if there is no craft at all. </p>

<p>The manner in which the story is adapted, whether you’ve read the book or not (I hadn’t), drops you into the lives of the March girls the same way an Avengers movie drops you into the middle of a decades-old mythology. The effect is pleasantly disorienting, and puts you in the mode of detective: scanning for clues and connective tissue about how the past and present will coordinate. The pace is intricate, the ambience relaxed, the melodrama subtle, and the way Greta Gerwig directs it all somehow makes a small world and the small people in it feel as big and important as a sky full of Star Destroyers is <em>supposed</em> to feel.</p>

<p>To be honest, this Top 10 list might simply be called “The Movies I Saw This Year”—there is so much I haven’t caught up with, and in the coming weeks, when/if I finally do see all those movies that are crowding the lists of other folks, some new films may be added, some old films may drop off. But I am certain, despite these gaps, that there was no film I could have liked better in 2019 than this one. </p>

<p>A few decades ago, I made a list of my 50 favourite all-time films. I was in my late teens, and considered myself a cinephile, well-watched, well-educated (at least relative to my average teenage peer). Somewhere in the 40s, behind all those movies it seems I was programmed from birth to love — <em>Aliens</em>, <em>The Thing</em>, <em>Goodfellas</em>, <em>Seven</em>, <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> — I listed Gillian Armstrong’s 1994 adaptation of <em>Little Women,</em> the one with Claire Danes and Winona Ryder. I can’t recall much about that film, but it struck me enough, clearly, to make my list, so perhaps I shouldn’t be surprised that I find myself once again enchanted by Louisa May Alcott’s gang. </p>

<p>That <em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em> and <em>Hobbs &amp; Shaw</em> are also on my list might make <em>Little Women</em> seem like an anomaly — or, worse, some misguided proclamation of my own wokeness — but it shares much in common with another of my favourites from this past year, <em>Booksmart</em>. Teenage girls, the bonds of sisterhood, the perils and pressures of seeking self-determination—none of these things are intimately familiar to me, but, to be fair, I’ve never been in a car chase or shootout, either, and all this proves, I think, is the preternatural magic of a great film: that it allows you to live another life, to see another world, to be utterly outside of yourself.  </p>

<p>I loved <em>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</em> for all the reasons that some people hate it: how meandering it was, how focused on the trials and anxieties of a person to whom we’re supposed to withhold our empathy: a white middle-aged man who wants more from the world. And yet: I myself am a white middle-aged man who wants more from the world, and <em>Little Women</em> spoke to me even more directly. Why? Because I loved it, and there is no logic to why and how you love the things you love; the heart simply wants what it wants, and my heart wants to be in Concord, Massachusetts, among the March girls as they find their way into the future. </p>

  				<p>Dear Fellow Critics, <br />
  				<p>We all know putting a film at the top of your personal list has more to do with activism than criticism. </p>

<p>You might claim it’s deductive reasoning to say a <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2019/11/15/the-irishman.html">gangster epic</a>, made with an uncompromising runtime, cutting edge technology, and the best actors of a generation (directed by a master of the medium), is the year’s unrivalled achievement. Or that the tonal tightrope being walked in recontextualizing a famous <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2019/7/30/once-upon-a-time-in-hollywood.html">Hollywood murder</a> provides irrefutable proof that cinema’s enfant terrible has matured into an auteur whose work demands the highest respect. Or that a South Korean film that has already won the triple crown of the Palme d’Or, near <a href="https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/parasite_2019">universal love</a>, and foreign film box-office <a href="https://www.thewrap.com/parasite-sets-foreign-language-record-at-indie-box-office/">records</a>, succeeded on so many levels that naming it anything other than the best of 2019 would be blatantly irresponsible. </p>

<p>Well, screw it. I’m still calling <em>Jallikattu</em> the best film of 2019. (<em>Parasite</em> will have to <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2020/1/3/c-redmonds-top-films-of-2019.html">settle</a> for #2.)</p>

<p>In truth, <em>Jallikattu</em> might have been my favourite film even before I saw it. But hear me out. I loathe <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/12/18/the-force-awakens.html">knee-jerk</a>, <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/5/11/the-avengers.html">fan-boy</a>, <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2019/4/28/avengers-endgame.html">uncritical</a>, <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2017/12/16/the-last-jedi.html">blind devotion</a> reviews that award five stars to any film that tickles teenage pleasure receptors. I’m also highly skeptical of the virtue signaling that comes from <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2019/2/11/sorry-to-bother-you-is-a-trip-and-the-best-film-of-2018.html">elevating</a> woke films with inventive storytelling but mediocre execution. And I feel embarrassed for contrarian picks that, at least in retrospect, just seem like a ploy for attention (even if it wasn’t - <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2017/1/16/swiss-army-man-is-the-best-and-ballsiest-film-of-2016.html">I swear</a>).</p>

<p>Yet here I am, going to bat for an obscure low-budget Indian film, with a title I can barely pronounce, acting like its shit doesn’t stink.  </p>

<p>Maybe I was an easy mark. After once again being overwhelmed by the annual TIFF catalogue of 350+ feature films, I found myself unnaturally attracted to a two-line recommendation by the festival’s artistic director Camera Bailey. A bull breaks loose in a village… <em>Jaws</em> in South India… SOLD! The film quickly raced to the top of my must-see list, and I managed to get a ticket to opening night. </p>

<p>But then I missed the screening. Actually, more like (agonizingly) skipped the screening in favour of a party, because free alcohol is a powerful thing and I’m a terrible critic. I resigned myself to the idea that <em>Jallikuttu</em> might be better remembered as “the one that got away”- a weird foreign genre film I would never see. One that couldn’t possibly live up to my own personal hype, anyway.</p>

<p>Two months later, out of nowhere, it’s on Amazon Prime. Available to watch from the comfort of my home, on a big TV screen, whenever I want. I had to decide - do I treat this like a Woody Allen film (none of which I’ve ever seen, for much less noble reasons than you’d assume), or do I tempt fate, risk disappointment, and just, you know, <em>watch</em> the film?</p>

<p>After a week of inexplicable contemplation, I chose the inevitable. And from the moment I pushed play, until the absolute bananas ending, I couldn’t wipe the stupid smile off my face. But for very different reasons from start to finish. </p>

<p>At first, I was amused by a regional certificate that’s stamped, scanned, and tacked onto the first few frames of the film. Then I was intrigued, more than re-assured, by a disclaimer stating that “all actions were performed on dummy animals, not live animals”, instead of getting the standard “no animals were harmed during production” clause we get in North America. And I was positively delighted by the title card drawn in mud, featuring a charging bull, dozens of people rushing up a hill, and the film’s untranslated Malayaman language title (which just looks like beautiful scribbles to someone like me, unfamiliar with the Vatteluttu alphabet).  </p>

<p>But then the credits start. First with an “in memoriam” card, then a list of sincere thanks. A long list of names occupying frames, from churches, to banks, to police, to individuals. Evidence that the filmmakers, too, are grateful for the film’s unlikely existence.</p>

<p>And then finally, sounds of a clock. Each tick and tock timed to the close-up of a new individual, dozens of them, asleep or waking up. The sound is coupled with heavy breathing, inhaling and exhaling, until we get busy shots of nature over a chanting soundtrack. It’s a spellbinding start, with an energy and pace that doesn’t relent for the next 90 minutes.</p>

<p>The only brief reprieve is a floating shot of a beautiful sunrise, punctuated with egalitarian opening credits that seem to arbitrarily alternate between above-the-line talent (producers, directors, department heads), and random parts of the production team (location sound, stills photography, assistant cameramen) all getting individual frames to themselves. And then it’s back to the tick-tock intro of lights being turned on, the village awakening, and the movie kicking into action.</p>

<p>Based on this description, and Bailey’s quick plot synopsis, it’s easy to expect a genre exercise where a rampaging bull murders villagers like a possessed shark. But this is where the film took a big turn for me. First, it’s a buffalo that’s on the loose, not a bull, and it’s running scared more than running wild. After escaping a sacrificial (and illegal) butchering for a wedding, the buffalo manages to evade villagers who are going crazy trying to catch it. No one owns a gun, and there are religious implications that seem to complicate the pursuit further. </p>

<p>A hunter is brought in, leading to every man within miles chaotically crowding around trying to catch a glimpse of the glory about to unfold. But as jealousies rage over who should get to make the kill, and who will get to claim the precious meat, the film (and characters) descend into a madness that made for one of the most thrilling, unexpected, and pointed climaxes I’ve ever seen. Enough so that I needed to show my wife at least the last five minutes of the film (a clear indicator, I <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2019/2/4/roma-is-a-gift-and-the-best-film-of-2018.html">realized last year</a>, that a film will probably make the top of my year end list). </p>

<p>This is the kind of filmmaking that still gets me excited about movies. Directed with unbridled can-do craftsmanship, Lijo Jose Pellissery’s restless camera lets you believe anything can happen and then <em>proves</em> it can with arresting, unforgettable visuals. The film is also as political as it is thrilling, not content to just make you feel something, but also to think about what happens in a world of growing needs and dwindling resources. It’s Mad Max without a hero, but it does, ultimately, have a sincere message. And so do I.</p>

<p>Jallikattu is the best film of 2019.</p>
