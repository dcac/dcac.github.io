    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Sometimes life can correct art. In season five of <em>The Wire</em> you played an investigative reporter who spun stories out of whole cloth just to boost your signal in the newsroom of the Baltimore Sun. Now, seven years later, you co-write and direct a film about the investigative arm of the Boston Globe (dubbed Spotlight) that literally changed the world. Because of the series of stories that the Globe published in the early 2000’s—stories that detail decades of sexual abuse by priests as well as the Catholic Church’s implication in a massive cover up—millions of people would come to reassess their relationship with the church, as well as with the people who are its ostensible guardians.</p>

<p><em>Spotlight</em> is a reversion to a kind of filmmaking that has often been declared dead and buried by countless (and as it turns out, alarmist) think pieces. Thoughtful and nuanced, the story spools out effortlessly. The performances are low key and far less heightened than most films that are trumpeted as Oscar bait. This is a true ensemble piece with strong turns from Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel MacAdams and Liev Schreiber—not to mention stellar work from Stanley Tucci in a small, but vital, performance. </p>

<p>The filmmaking itself is invisible—a return to the kind of aesthetic that made films like <em>All The Presidents Men</em> or even <em>The French Connection</em> feel like they were one degree away from real. In the same way that well written dialogue goes unnoted, the audience is completely unaware of the architecture of the work and is left to simply absorb the narrative. Much like last year’s <em>A Most Violent Year</em> or even <em>Timbuktu</em>, <em>Spotlight</em> is a medium budget film that puts lie to the idea that there is no such thing as adult entertainment that doesn’t end with the suffix <strong>hub</strong>.</p>

<p>It is a subtle pleasure to watch something so carefully modulated. There are very few moments of high drama. Instead we all get to see how the sausage is made—the whole movie gives itself over to the fascinating process of how a story so monumental is found in nooks and crannies, detail by detail—by professionals who are dedicated to their craft. And the resulting piece of art is completely riveting.</p>

<p><em>Spotlight</em> is a clear example of how film can parse fraught and incendiary themes with intelligence and sensitivity. You managed a balance between blunt truths and an understanding that these are real people, not just mannequins you rearrange to create narrative flourishes. Nor is <em>Spotlight</em> an instrument of advocacy other than demonstrating the value of an increasingly rare sort of journalistic enterprise. Everyone populating the landscape you helped create were characters with complicated, and often conflicted, motivations and desires.</p>

<p><em>Station Agent,</em> a film of yours I happened across years ago, is an intimate, small-scale  funny/sad story about a group of socially ill-equipped humans finding community with one another—and in so many ways is a necessarily different work than <em>Spotlight</em>. But the two films do share one commonality: a fundamental compassion about the fragility at the core of the human condition. With <em>Spotlight</em> you managed to create something that simultaneously honors that fragility and yet never launders the ugly truths at the core of the story. That kind of tightrope walk is a rare pleasure to watch.</p>

    <id>/content/2015/11/13/suffragette</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>In 1913 you quite literally gave your life for the cause; the right for women to vote. You and your sisters-in-arms endured public humiliation, beatings at the hands of police, and brutal stints in prison. Not to mention, you know, the widespread, garden-variety sexism that was the norm in early 20th century Britain. Along with famed suffrage leader Emmeline Pankhurst and others, you espoused confrontational tactics in order to gain attention and support for the cause. You broke windows, blew shit up, and the government branded you terrorists. What you really were was an epic badass and a hero. </p>

<p>So why did you only show up half way through <em>Suffragette</em>?</p>

<p>You’d be pleased to know that the film about a movement you helped foster was written by a woman, and directed by a woman (who worked very hard to make sure the crew behind the camera was populated by a <a href="http://www.fastcocreate.com/3052619/suffragette-director-sarah-gavron-on-fixing-the-gender-imbalance-in-filmmaking">proportionate number of women</a>). But instead of focusing on you or the militant organization behind suffrage, the movie chooses an unlikely hero to be our entry point into the story; a poor, working class mother. </p>

<p>Carey Mulligan plays Maud Watts, a laundry employee fed up with unfair working conditions and her predatory boss. Though reluctant to join the suffrage movement, she soon becomes deeply engaged in the cause, becoming what the local constabulary refer to as an “agitator”. Her humiliated husband kicks her out and forbids her to see her young son, thus making the suffrage movement the only thing in Maud’s life worth fighting for. </p>

<p>If you don’t recognize the name Maud Watts, it’s because she, and some other characters are fictional. Writer Abi Morgan lets us watch Maud grow from an obedient wife and employee, to a radicalized suffragette. Morgan, who also wrote <em>Shame</em> and <em>Iron Lady</em>, is an actor’s writer  - just ask Michael Fassbender, and Meryl Streep (blink and you’ll miss her cameo here as Pankhurst). She leaves a lot of the character off the page and in the hands of Mulligan, who lets Maud emerge with melancholic dignity. Other characters, like Helena Bonham Carter’s rebellious nurse Edith Ellyn, and Maud’s stern husband Sonny, are not given as much dimension. </p>

<p>Real or composite, many of the characters and scenarios feel rote, with the exception of the scenes between Maud and Inspector Arthur Steed, who is tasked with taking down the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU). Played with grizzled righteousness by Brendon Gleeson, Steed compares the suffragettes to anarchists and Fenian agitators, and sees them as a threat against the government and the king. Mulligan and Gleeson’s interactions are reminiscent of those between Bobby Sands and Father Dominic in <em>Hunger</em>; rife with tension, steely resolve, and begrudging respect. Sadly these interactions are too few. </p>

<p>Director Sarah Gavron infuses <em>Suffragette</em> with diligent attention to period detail while subtly illustrating the progress of the new century beside the tenuous grasp of the old. Double decker buses share the road with horses and carriages, the WSPU uses telephones and printing presses, Steel’s officers use cameras to secretly to track the suffragette’s movements, all in effort to remind us that this really wasn’t such a long time ago. </p>

<p>Perhaps your character is not given as much screen time because Morgan and Gavron thought the audience would find it easier to root for a woman who has lost everything. <em>Suffragette</em>, unfortunately, isn’t really for me, but for a younger audience of women and men who maybe aren’t so familiar with the early women’s rights movement. This is why at times the film feels like a primer. <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2015/10/what-did-suffragette-movement-britain-really-look">The real suffrage movement</a> was far more fractious and messy – it included women of colour, lesbians, imperialism, elitism, racism, and people and events that don’t necessarily lend themselves to an easy narrative. </p>

<p>The backlash against the movie <em>Suffragette</em> for <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/film/feature/2015/11/04/23117815/why-our-reviewer-refuses-to-write-a-review-of-suffragette">white-washing history</a>, and against the cast for <a href="http://flavorwire.com/541222/meryl-streeps-suffragette-t-shirt-disaster-what-were-they-thinking">being tone-deaf</a>, is unfortunate but not unwarranted. The movie is good, but not good enough to rise above its own prejudices. Your triumphant heroics – and those of Sophia Duleep Singh, Annie Kenney and others - are worthy of their own biopic. If that happens, I’ll be sure to let you know how it turns out.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Forgive me if I don’t know where to send this letter, but you’ve been incommunicado since Stephen Harper’s slaughter at the hands of the Liberal Party on October 19th. Can’t say I blame you. Running a federal campaign is an exhausting (and mostly thankless) task. Regardless of the result, it should conclude with a well-earned rest. Hell, just watching it was a pretty tiresome, despite the occasional laugh and a not-so-predictable ending. </p>

<p>But those aren’t the only things the Canadian election had in common with <em>Our Brand Is Crisis.</em></p>

<p>It’s no secret that your campaign unraveled and you were unceremoniously dumped by the outgoing PM the day after his crushing defeat. But in 2011, you were celebrated as the brains behind Stephen Harper’s triumphant majority win. You were known as an Alpha: a rigid, on-message task-master. You were powerful. You were feared. You were employed. Now you’re...well, where <em>are</em> you? If you were campaign specialist “Calamity” Jane Bodine, the protagonist of <em>Our Brand Is Crisis</em>, you’d be licking your wounds in a mountain cabin, far away from the addictive pull of politics. </p>

<p>Like your campaign, <em>Our Brand Is Crisis</em> had a lot of early buzz. But, like your campaign, it fizzles quickly. We learn Jane’s backstory through the lazy device of a newspaper-clipping montage during the credits; a once-shining star on the campaign trail cut down by a drinking problem, mental instability, and hubris, Jane spends her days making unremarkable pottery in the middle of nowhere. An opportunity to make a comeback of sorts by working on the campaign of a conservative former president seeking re-election in Bolivia – and a chance to face her long-time nemesis – brings her out of retirement. </p>

<p>Maybe it’s because people around the world seem to know as much about Canada as they do about Bolivia, but the similarities between their <a href="http://www.salon.com/2015/10/28/the_real_story_of_our_brand_is_crisis_is_how_we_screwed_up_bolivia_behind_the_bland_sandra_bullock_movie_lies_another_strange_but_true_tale_of_botched_american_meddling/">quasi-fictional</a> election and ours were eerie. Jane’s candidate, Castillo, is a cold, unpopular conservative who seems physically incapable of relating to his electorate. His previous presidency was rife with corruption and controversy. His first, ludicrously-staged campaign ad is comically bad. The opponent he wants to beat is Rivera, a universally loved man of the people running on the promise of “hope and change”. At one point Jane even exclaims, “his hair is amazing!” The strategy she comes up with is to run Castillo’s campaign on fear. “You can’t change the man to fit the narrative, so we’ll change the narrative to fit the man.” </p>

<p>If I were you I’d seriously consider seeking a retroactive consulting fee from the film’s producers.</p>

<p>Ever since the <em>West Wing</em>, it seems that stories about behind-the-scenes political machinations feel the need to keep up a breathless, Sorkin-esque pace that can be both false and exhausting. Refreshingly, <em>Our Brand Is Crisis</em> (loosely based on the documentary of the same name) tries to operate more at the pace of <em>Primary Colours</em> or <em>The War Room,</em> films which put the spotlight on the people behind the candidates. By now audiences understand that the inner sanctum of any government is full of huge personalities, massive egos, and more than a little bit of insanity. But after the wacky hijinks and cutthroat back-room dealings are done, we aren’t left with characters who have much depth—<em>or</em> a story with anything fresh to say. </p>

<p>Jane’s rival, Candy, is a slimy D-bag played by Billy Bob Thornton in a role he seems to have been born to play…over and over again. Their rivalry began years ago when Jane, working for a mayoral candidate, still had morals. Morals that were dashed by a tragedy for which she may or may not have been responsible. Now Candy is working for Rivera, and his passive-aggressive, back-and-forth practical jokes with Jane fuel much of the anemic narrative. The Bolivians are the great unwashed, their struggles only important inasmuch as they provide Jane the opportunity to spout bromides like a random quote generator. Politics is a dirty game, not for the meek or idealistic. Yeah, we know.</p>

<p>But hey, maybe those pedestrian tactics work. <a href="http://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/politics/meet-the-woman-driving-harpers-re-election-campaign/article24699535/">You were known</a> to pull out a picture of yourself as a little girl, standing proudly beside your father with a freshly killed deer at your feet, to remind Conservatives that they were fighting for people outside of the Ottawa bubble. <a href="http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/canada-election-2015-jenni-byrne-tossed-1.3280702">But some insiders now think</a> that, beyond your bullish personality, the fact that you are a woman may have lead to your ultimate demise. Early scuttlebutt surrounding <em>Our Brand Is Crisis</em> focused on the fact that the role of Jane was originally written for a man, then <a href="http://www.ew.com/article/2015/08/12/sandra-bullock-our-brand-crisis-first-look">Bullock lobbied</a> to star in the lead. But producers Grant Heslov and George Clooney and writer Peter Straughan (working from Rachel Boynton’s doc) seem content to merely swap out the genders instead of adding any unique layers to Jane. They missed an opportunity to explore the challenges inherent when a difficult woman is in charge of getting an unworthy man elected. </p>

<p>Politics and the film business have some distinct parallels: it takes a whole team of dedicated people to get a project done, and when it fails, it’s far too easy to blame one person. In the case of Harper and <em>Our Brand Is Crisis</em>, neither team seemed interested in delivering something new, and in the end, the message just didn’t sell.</p>

    <title>The Peanuts Movie</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Adaptations or remakes are generally tough to pull off. They require a careful balance between preserving the essence of the original, and making it new enough for there to be any point to the exercise. I’ve been a fan of Peanuts since I was a kid, but I honestly didn’t see Charles Schulz’s characters lending themselves too well to the high octane, pithy style of animated features we’re used to. A big part of the charm of Peanuts is its quiet simplicity. I was curious as to how (or even if) you would give the beloved cartoon enough verve and punch for the younger crowd while preserving the old-fashioned sweetness for those of us who crack up at the sound of Miss Othmar’s voice, and say ‘Oh, good grief’ like it’s still a thing. </p>

<p>A school year serves as a very basic narrative frame for <em>The Peanuts Movie</em>. There is no plot to speak of, just a series of events on the school calendar (first day, standardized test, school dance, etc.) loosely tied together by Charlie Brown’s quest to win the affections of the Little Readheaded Girl. There is some sort of parallel Flying Ace/Red Baron fantasy plot featuring Snoopy and Woodstock, and it’s cute enough, but given that they have more-than-ample screen time in the main plot, I’m not sure why this was necessary. There are a couple of points at which the two plotlines intersect quite cleverly, but they could have easily been stand-alone gags.</p>

<p>The biggest departure from the original comics and cartoons is the film’s visual aesthetic, which trades Schulz’s shaky pencilled lines for more a more solid, vivid look. It’s new, but maintains the softness and charm I’m used to. I also appreciated that the more outdated elements of the Peanuts world are left alone. Thank you for not swapping out the rotary phones with smart phones, and for making Charlie Brown fly an actual kite rather than struggle with some sort of Kite Krusher app. </p>

<p>The film is basically 90 minutes worth of Peanuts strips strung together and brought to life, and I was curious as to whether this would be a good or bad thing. Sure, Charlie Brown’s sad-sack meanderings are great in small doses, but I wasn’t sure sustained, feature-length sad-sackery would be all that appealing. However, this is where the rest of the Peanuts gang really shines. Seeing Charlie Brown through the eyes of characters like Linus and Sally lets us appreciate his loyalty and tenacity in between laughing at one botched undertaking after another.</p>

<p>Because there are so many quintessentially Peanuts elements that have to be included, the film feels like it’s checking things off a list of trademark gags and one-liners without much thought to how or where they actually fit into the narrative, or even if they need to be in there at all. There had to have been a better spot for the Charlie Brown/Lucy/football gag than being shoehorned into a few seconds during the end credits. </p>

<p>While <em>The Peanuts Movie</em> retains much of the charm of Schulz’s work, and has enough to entertain long-time fans as well as newer, younger audiences, it just didn’t appeal to me on the same level as the comic strips, or previous animated adaptations. For me, the beauty of Peanuts is how it invites you to linger over a single vignette, and <em>The Peanuts Movie</em> flips through its various antics and misadventures a little too quickly. Just my five cents’ worth – for the doctor’s cookie jar, of course.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p><em>Warning: Spoilers Throughout</em></p>

<p>You and I are the same age James (at least your movie incarnation) both being born in the black and white world of 1962. That you—or at least a very specific iteration of you—died so early seems inevitable. That I lived to see it is just disappointing</p>

<p><em>Spectre</em> is an unintentionally apt title for this film James, since you are now a ghost of what you once were—and a pitiful, declawed ghost at that. The brutish, unmannered pig we were introduced to in <em>Casino Royale</em> has evolved into a character that is close to indistinguishable from some overwrought Roger Moore/Pierce Brosnan hybrid. Sans the invisible car, thankfully. Although we do get the front half of a plane skiing down a hill.</p>

<p>Jesus.</p>

<p>There were hints of this in <em>Skyfall—</em>intimations of a return to the smarmy, ludicrously heightened Bond. The old Aston Martin, the return of a male M, Moneypenny back in the office. I had hoped those moments were just a bit of fan service, a bump in the road before we got back to what makes your character so compelling: the fact that you are a blunt instrument of realpolitik; the ugly, twisted tip of the spear.</p>

<p>Instead, in this new installment, over the course of one hundred and forty eight minutes, you are utterly de-balled. The film begins well enough, with an effectively tense and well-choreographed opening sequence. Superb really. But at the very end of that sequence something occurred that made me cringe—and that small moment made it clear that Bond was back. But it was the small b-Bond, with the dad jokes and the annoying visual gags, not the Bond that you actually believed might be worthy of a double O designation.</p>

<p>And here’s the thing: the world has moved on. The character you were initially modeled on was repugnant. Ian Fleming’s Bond was a racist homophobe who couldn’t comprehend the term cultural sensitivity, let alone practice it. He was the epitome of a kind of colonialism that was, and is, completely toxic. The fact that the filmmakers choose to move you along with the world may have been expedient, but it destroyed the very thing that made you such a durable and interesting character. </p>

<p>That Bond was also someone who would much rather die than evolve. He smoked seventy cigarettes a day and drank like a fish. Jittery and bleak-minded he epitomized a life that absolutely precluded dying old and in bed. He was a spy with a license to kill, and he enjoyed the shit out of that prerogative.  </p>

<p>That Bond was a nasty dinosaur, a man literally out of time, and by far the most interesting incarnation by any standard. The man who, bare-handed, beat another man to death in <em>Casino Royale</em>—in black and white no less—has now given way to a man who throws his weapon of choice aside in order to ride off into the sunset with his girlfriend.</p>

<p>For you to exist in any meaningful way James, you have to contrast with your environment—you have to be the antithesis of a chameleon. For you, to <em>adapt</em> is to <em>die</em>. And if you continue down this road, it will be a slow, undignified expiration.</p>

<p>A <em>Spectre</em> of your former self indeed.</p>

    <id>/content/2015/11/5/crimson-peak</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>If the lyric “every artist is a cannibal” holds any truth at all, it just might explain why you are more than a little rotund. You voraciously consume every sort of genre and then spew out a glorious mess that is neither beast nor fowl. If that seems indelicate and lyrical at the same time it is because that it what your work always seems to reduce to—a kind of lurid poetry that is impossible to ignore.</p>

<p>There is no point in trying to assess <em>Crimson Peak</em> by the usual metrics because its value is located somewhere far to the south of the standard criteria. Plot, consistency in tone, genre fidelity aren’t your primary concerns. Instead your work reads like something the Quay Bros. would produce—after being force fed ether by David Lynch. </p>

<p><em>Crimson Peak</em> is a film full of heightened performances, fifty two layers of metaphor in each frame, art direction inspired by a mix of Hieronymus Bosch and Durer with a touch of Mary Shelley and the Bronte’s, as well an innocence that sees this all as wondrous rather than grotesque. An elaborate children’s tea party that ends with all the dolls beheaded.</p>

<p>There are a lot of people this film will not impress. On its surface it’s an ornate melodrama punctuated by moments of horrific violence. It’s most overt metaphor is the awakening of the artist—in this case personified by Mia Wasikowska with her usual brilliance—which will irritate the hell out of the less esoterically inclined. It is neither as viscerally affecting as <em>Pan’s Labyrinth</em> nor as filled with childhood melancholy as <em>Devil’s Backbone</em>. What it does have though is a kind of sub rosa power that really doesn’t hit until long after the film is over.</p>

<p><em>Crimson Peak</em> is what Charlie Kaufman’s <em>Adaptation</em> would look like if it were re-interpreted as a historical romance sprinkled in gore. The narrative evolves as Wasikowska’s character—Edith Cushing—becomes more and more engaged with her own vocation as a writer. Each character that comes into (or in one case tragically and violently leaves) her life changes the tone of the story: the film begins as a stilted, turn-of-the-century period piece set in Buffalo NY and ends as Gothic horror. The finale occurs at a moor-locked, dilapidated manor house surrounded by newly fallen snow—snow that is stained blood red by seeping clay pits. </p>

<p>Subtlety thy name is <em>not</em> Del Toro.</p>

<p><em>Crimson Peak</em> is, more than anything else, a visually preposterous film. There is so much beauty and excess that it often threatens to overwhelm, but you have an innate capacity to fill the frame exactly up to the line,but never over. Jessica Chastain and Tom Hiddleston manage to make a sibling relationship seem both wrong and undeniably charged. Charlie Hunnam suits his character as well his period costume fit him (which is just fine) and Jim Beaver is starting to rival Sean Bean as the character least likely to make it to the third act. There are whole passages cribbed from Jane Eyre, I half expected Gary Oldman to appear stage left in his Dracula drag and there is an actual elevator to hell that plays a fairly prominent role in the latter half of the film.</p>

<p>And yet somehow, through some bizarre alchemy it seems impossible to pin down, this is a serious film made by an artist at the height of his powers. <em>Crimson Peak</em> has an ambiguous character that is both unsettling and riveting: a cherub disguised as a monster. Either way, it is a film worth the grapple.</p>

    <id>/content/2015/11/4/truth</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>I trust you were extra careful with every paper you handled on the set of <em>Truth</em>. Like, anal retentive, triple-check, hyper-cautiously-aware of your responsibilities. Sure, you were only hired as a production assistant, but first-time director James Vanderbilt obviously knows the importance of a solid paper trail after adapting Mary Mapes’ novel, so he must have hired you specifically to make sure everything was by-the-book. Otherwise, you know—the whole project/company/profession could have come crashing down.</p>

<p>No pressure.</p>

<p>It’s this kind of high-stakes attention to detail that sits at the heart of Vanderbilt’s film adaptation of <em>Truth and Duty: The Press, the President, and the Privilege of Power</em>, a first-hand account of the infamous CBS 60 Minutes news segment that questioned President George W. Bush’s military service record. What began as an earnest fact-finding mission about whether or not Bush was given a cushy job with the National Guard to avoid combat in Vietnam turned into a shadowy chess match between obscure sources with even more obscure motivations—one that famously cost host Dan Rather and producer Mary Mapes their careers.</p>

<p>The 60 Minutes segment aired during the 2004 presidential election, and was journalistically justified, in part, by Republican attacks against the service record of Democratic Presidential candidate John Kerry. But, with the help of a sleuth internet community, major questions arose about the authenticity of a key document being featured. The typeface, critics argued, matched those of a 2004 Word processor perfectly, and wasn’t the same as the ones found in most typewriters from 1971. More specifically, a superscript font appeared to be anachronistic. Within days, the story quickly shifted from Bush’s record to that of the news team that broke the story.</p>

<p>Much in the same way that the true scope of this story snuck up on the reporters, so too does the drama in Vanderbilt’s telling. The gravitas of what is happening isn’t apparent early on, nor was it for me as a university journalist student when this incident was first unfolding. After all, the media is famous for aggrandizing their own importance. And in the digital age, it has become fashionable to cheer the demise of the old establishment, even if it’s just to watch it burn. But seeing their credibility go up in smoke is a much more somber experience from the inside.  </p>

<p>What really makes this film work, however, are the more progressive elements of the story—namely, prioritizing Mapes’ story over Rather’s (who, in the public, was the much more prominent player). Experiencing the pile-on from a female perspective adds an intangible strength to the story in which the opposition came directly from the old boys club. Cate Blanchett navigates her role with the dignity you’d expect, and even gets backing from her (non-)trope “supportive husband”. Sure, Mapes’ psychology is a bit reductive (daddy-issues, with some on-the-nose dialogue to hammer the point home), but her professional motivations and methods are less easy to pick apart. </p>

<p>The film is also, thankfully, workmanlike in its approach, devoid of the hyperbolic visual flare that plagued <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/10/22/the-fifth-estate.html"><em>The Fifth Estate</em></a>, focusing instead on the details. A lot of care went into translating what was on the page onto the screen, which is exactly what a good journalism is all about. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>With all due respect, from one writer to another I have to ask: Dude, what the hell?</p>

<p>Even though there are a trio of writers behind <em>The Last Witch Hunter</em>, I’m singling you out because it was your encounter with Vin Diesel, and your shared love for <em>Dungeons &amp; Dragons</em>, that brought this abomination to life. </p>

<p>Yes, abomination. </p>

<p>When I was a child, the fantasy genre was my absolute favorite. I would spend hours creating stories, assigning characters and playing out my creation with assorted G.I. Joes, rubbing red Crayola on my toys if they ‘bled’.  I would play in the bathtub if an ocean setting were required—hell, I would even create TV shows, with episodes and seasons. I literally grew up with this genre. So when I heard Vin Diesel was going to be able to live in his nerd Valhalla, I was a tad jealous. But after viewing <em>The Last Witch Hunter</em>, I was just insulted by the dumbed down, clichéd mess. It’s not just bland, predictable and forced, it’s a haphazard Frankensteining of <em>The Mummy Returns, The Sorcerer’s Apprentice </em>and<em> Halloweentown.</em></p>

<p><em>The Last Witch Hunter </em>is the generation-spanning tale of Kaulder (sounds an <em>awful </em>lot like cauldron), an infamous witch hunter who was cursed with immortality 800 years ago by the evil witch queen. What follows is the tired, old dribble that accompanies all gothic fantasy films. </p>

<p>Kaulder now operates out of modern-day New York as a bounty hunter of sorts, capturing evil witches and sentencing them to imprisonment—and what’s an imprisonment without a secret court of witch elders who handle the sentencing of magical criminals? It’s the obvious choice. </p>

<p>I didn’t even need to watch the movie, let alone the trailer, to figure out that Kaulder would be draped in black and silver, and that most of the scenery would feature cold buildings made out of brick and iron. Furthermore, the reciting of spells had to be the most painstaking load of enunciated vowels strung along with an echoed whisper, ever. I’m thinking of parseltongue from Harry Potter—and I know you were too.</p>

<p>There is zero subtlety here. You have to remind us at every single turn that we are in the presence of witches: potions, magic stones, horned creatures, insect swarms—you pretty much Googled a list of everything related to witchery and crammed it in. </p>

<p>When we are introduced to Chloe’s bar, we aren’t invited into a seemingly normal bar where witches and wizards can sit back, relax and have a pint like us regular folk. No, we’re invited into a secret world where, instead of alcohol, glowing potions are served, and instead of table lights, there are illuminated, wispy clouds circulating above patron’s heads.  </p>

<p>And somehow you had the gall to push it further. Kaulder actually says the word “magic” out loud when he witnesses a spell. Really, Cory? The man has been around for 800 years and is a witch hunter—why the fuck does he have to say “magic” when he sees it? We get it: <em>The Last Witch Hunter </em>is a movie about witches. </p>

<p>The worst part is that I knew it would be bad—yet I still left disappointed. Fantasy fans should be treated to a better representation of the genre in 2015. <em>The Last Witch Hunter</em> was all sorts of toil and trouble.</p>

<p>Sincerely,</p>

<p>Ankit  </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>I know why you really got into the business. It wasn’t because you’re a masochist for long hours or a sucker for uncertain income. You think film is sexy. Actually, you <em>know</em> film is sexy. And you’re right.</p>

<p>If you’re attracted to a career in filmmaking, it’s only natural that the people in the industry will turn your crank. But beware – there’s a hierarchy of hotness on set.</p>

<p>Here’s a wildly subjective ranking of roles, and what gives them different degrees of bedability. Actors have been disqualified for obvious reasons (they’re all bat-shit crazy).</p>

<p><strong>16. Data Wrangler</strong></p>

<p>Look, somebody had to be last. And let’s face it – most Data Wranglers have their heads buried in a laptop all day and rarely register on set. When you do, it’s usually disastrous. Being the bearer of bad news that a file is corrupt or a card won’t read is the ultimate buzz kill – even if it’s not your fault (and it usually isn’t). Sure, you can sometimes score points with actors by giving them a sneak peak at the digital dailies, but even then you’re just being used. It’s sad to say that the one job on set with zero room for error is not exactly a head turner, but at least you made the list (sorry, <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/3/9/cloudburst.html">Craft Services</a>). </p>

<p><em>Letter: Dear Arnaud Hemery Data Manager for</em> <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/7/25/lucy.html"><em>LUCY</em></a></p>

<p><strong>15. Production Assistant</strong></p>

<p>You’re not last! It wouldn’t be fair to pick on this job, especially since so many of us have been PA’s at one time or another. Yes, it’s unglamorous and often attracts unskilled go-getters, but stick around because itgetsbetter. People usually have an eye on you (to see if you fuck up), but at least competence will get you noticed. It’s an entry level-job with big-time make-over potential. </p>

<p><em>Letter: Dear Natalie Wood Production Assistant for</em> <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/5/14/downhill-racer.html"><em>DOWNHILL RACER</em></a></p>

<p><strong>14. Dolly Grip</strong></p>

<p>Here’s a job that many people enjoy doing, but few people enjoy watching. Dolly Grip’s win “Most Likely to Flash Plumber Crack”, but are not nearly as likely to get any ass themselves. The process of laying track and guiding the camera is one that requires a lot of focus and steady work, so luckily most Dolly Grips are too busy to care what anyone else thinks. That’s worth something. </p>

<p><em>Letter: Dear Bruce Hamme, Dolly Grip for</em> <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/9/10/prisoners.html"><em>PRISONERS</em></a></p>

<p><strong>13. Props Master</strong></p>

<p>Being a Prop Master is only as sexy as you make it. Depending on the film, you’ll have various chances to show off your good taste and handy skills. The only problem is that once props are loaned out, most of you turn into neurotic headcases trying to keep track of everything; making sure that vintage book pages aren’t torn or that the vase in the background gets back to your grandma safely. Lack of control inevitably loses you points.</p>

<p><em>Letter: Dear Michael S. Martin, Property Master for</em> <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/11/13/12-years-a-slave.html"><em>12 YEARS A SLAVE</em></a></p>

<p><strong>12. Continuity / Scrip Supervisor</strong></p>

<p>Good continuity is a total turn on, but more in a reliable relationship way. You got here by proving you have a great attention to detail, and as such, are often seated at the right hand of the director to keep an eye on loose strings. Like many relationships, pointing out inconsistencies or faults might be encouraged early on, but you also have to be okay with being regularly dismissed or overruled. It’s a tricky dynamic to have work in your favour.</p>

<p><em>Letter: Dear Ronit Ravich-Boss, Script Supervisor for</em> <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/6/21/thats-my-boy.html"><em>THAT’S MY BOY</em></a></p>

<p><strong>11. Best Boy</strong></p>

<p>Like the Best Man at a wedding Best Boy is a true misnomer (shouldn’t the “best man” be the one getting married?). Second-in-command of either the Grip or Gaffer department, the term dates back to when managers would yell “bring me your best boy!” to come help with lighting or electrical. This official wingman status is often a thankless job, but at the same time, being shown favour on a big set gets you noticed. Plus, some people would probably hook up with a Best Boy just to say they did. </p>

<p><em>Letter: Dear Greg Fusak, Best Boy for</em> <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/5/29/behind-the-candelabra.html"><em>BEHIND THE CANDLEABRA</em></a></p>

<p><strong>10. Line Producer</strong></p>

<p>Though being the money manager isn’t as sexy as it sounds, there’s some true power here, and that’s the basis for most of the appeal. Many of the department heads are likely to cozy up to a Line Producer just to try and squeeze a little extra money their way. Enjoy it. It’s the best play you have. </p>

<p><em>Letter: Dear Sarah Craig, Line Producer for</em> <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/8/7/time-lapse.html"><em>TIME LAPSE</em></a></p>

<p><strong>9. Unit Production Manager</strong></p>

<p>What’s hotter than hiring and firing people? Well, a lot, but this is still a position that demands respect on set. Points are mainly lost by being so removed from the action when the camera’s rolling, usually holed up in a trailer somewhere crunching numbers and fixing schedules. But with the power to make or break many below-the-line careers, it’s no wonder there’s a little strut in your step. </p>

<p><em>Letter: Dear Brian Bell, Unit Production Manager on</em> <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/5/9/neighbors.html"><em>NEIGHBORS</em></a></p>

<p><strong>8. Assistant Director</strong></p>

<p>There have to be some cheats here, so I’m grouping all you A.D.’s together, even if the difference between a First, Second and Third is rather huge. It goes without saying that your appeal is directly related to your ranking – no one’s getting hot and bothered by a Third A.D. bossing extras around (well, bothered maybe), and Seconds are usually tucked away in the office somewhere (which at least provides an air of mystique). An effective First A.D., however, really has presence on set – even if all the yelling has more in common with a drill sergeant than a rock singer. In fact, using the band analogy, First A.D.’s are more like the drummer – making a lot of noise and keeping the rhythm of the production going. And we all know drummers get plenty of action. </p>

<p><em>Letter: Dear Lauren Wells-Jones, Casual Assistant Director for</em> <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/12/8/the-babadook.html"><em>THE BABADOOK</em></a></p>

<p><strong>7. Make-up Artist/Costume Designer</strong></p>

<p>If there’s a cool kids club on set, Make-up and Costumes are the gatekeepers. You get a lot of face time with the stars and are the hub of production gossip. But the real appeal comes from being so hands on; cozying up with measurements and touch-ups, striking a quick level of intimacy and familiarity the actors. By extension, Make-Up Artists and Costumer Designers are usually approachable and friendly by nature. Both disciplines (combined here for simplicity) are true art forms in and of themselves, where excellence can be rewarded with an Oscar or a spot on SyFy’s FaceOff. That’s hot. </p>

<p><em>Letter: Dear Robin Matthews, Makeup Department Head for</em> <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/1/4/wild.html"><em>WILD</em></a></p>

<p><strong>6. Boom Operator</strong></p>

<p>If you don’t have a sense of humour, you can’t be a boom operator. The big rod you brandish makes you the butt end of easy jokes, but owning that absurdity goes a long way. It’s a low level position, but also the most visible one in the sound department – and the most fit. Keeping your mic out of the frame isn’t easy. Arm strength is one thing, but there’s also an agility required to keep up with hand-held moving action. For that reason, you’re hotter than you think. Plus, who doesn’t love somehow who knows how to work a pole?</p>

<p><em>Letter: Dear Valeria Ghiran, Boom Operator for</em> <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/3/2/the-artist.html"><em>THE ARTIST</em></a></p>

<p><strong>5. Grip/Gaffer</strong></p>

<p>Another big cheat to combine these two professions, but the same principles of attraction apply to setting up lights and laying cables. These are technical jobs that require both brain and brawn. Both land on a respectable rung of the professional ladder, and watching someone who really knows what they’re doing is always appealing. But really, this ranking is all about the belts. A lot of people wear them, but no one on set owns them like a Grip and Gaffer. </p>

<p><em>Letter: Dear Andy Mountain, Lighting Console Operator for</em> <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/6/11/under-the-skin.html"><em>UNDER THE SKIN</em></a></p>

<p><strong>4. Director</strong> </p>

<p>An ego monster by necessity, a director’s magnetism is a real crapshoot. Everyone on set is judging you, and expecting an answer to their question. If you make mistakes, people talk behind your back. If you act like a big shot without delivering world-class goods, word travels fast that you’re an insecure phony. But no matter what people say, you’re endowed with creative control – and that’s impossible to ignore. If you do all your homework, treat people well, and , your sex appeal is second-to-none. But more often than not, seeing the sausage being made is a pretty heavy turn-off.  </p>

<p><em>Letter: Dear Marc Foster, Director of</em> <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/6/19/world-war-z.html"><em>WORLD WAR Z</em></a></p>

<p><strong>3. Production Designer</strong> </p>

<p>You could be working anywhere – drafting buildings, designing big brands, creating personal installations – but you’ve chosen to give your talents to film. The wild variety of skill sets most Production Designers and Art Directors possess make you the most interesting people on set. Most of you care as much about Neo-classical architecture as you do contemporary tech interfaces. You might not sweat as much as the Grips and Gaffer, but you don’t need to. Plus, even in jeans and T-shirt, you still seem to dress better than most people on set.  </p>

<p><em>Letter: Dear Bobby Vanonen, Production Design/Art Direction for</em> <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/3/6/the-valley-below.html"><em>THE VALLEY BELOW</em></a></p>

<p><strong>2. Stunt Coordinator</strong></p>

<p>Not many sets have the luxury of a true Stunt Coodinator (or even stunt performers), but the ones that do – look out. Everyone’s eyes are on your action. It’s a rough and tumble profession, and one that, at its best, risks life and limb for our entertainment (will somebody give you and Oscar category already?). The reason it’s so high isn’t just because of the Ryan Gosling <em>Drive</em> factor, but the stunt makers who have really broken out, from Bruce Lee to Zoë Bell. Even when you’re doubling for a star, you’re the real show on set.</p>

<p><em>Letter: Dear Brian Smyj, Stunt Coordinator for</em> <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/4/12/the-place-beyond-the-pines.html"><em>THE PLACE BEYOND THE PINES</em></a></p>

<ol>
<li><strong>Cinematographer</strong></li>
</ol>

<p>Was there ever any doubt? If the Director is the singer of a rock band, the Cinematographer is the lead guitar. It’s where the real music comes from, and where fans know to focus their attention. As the architect of light and movement, the Cinematographer (or Director of Photography) has enough help to side step most of the drama that plagues other department heads. And even so, you’re often the hardest working person on set. Most Directors are disproportionately indebted to their Cinematographer, so they can’t begrudge the praise you get. But don’t think they aren’t jealous when an A-list movie star<a href="http://variety.com/2015/film/news/emmanuel-lubezki-wins-oscar-for-cinematography-1201439231/">lovingly uses your nick-name</a> to announce your Oscar win to the world. </p>

    <id>/content/2015/10/27/beasts-of-no-nation</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>In today’s increasingly fractured media landscape, acquiring great content is more important than ever. DIY distribution companies are popping up like weeds, and film festivals crawl all over each other like roaches fighting for exclusive premieres. And if people like you don’t position a film properly at the outset, it’s almost guaranteed to be a bust.  You only get one chance to launch a film, no matter how big or small the budget. So choosing a Netflix release – rather than a traditional theatrical release – for <em>Beasts of No Nation</em> was certainly a bold move. It made the industry stand up and take notice. The question is, will the public follow, too?</p>

<p>It’s not an easy sell. Idris Elba certainly has his fans, but the film otherwise boasts a cast of mostly first-time African actors. The difficult subject matter of Uzodinma Iweala’s novel, from which the film is adapted, probably didn’t line up any buyers, either. But enough people saw potential in the brutal story of child soldiers in Ghana that the film was financed and completed. </p>

<p>Then along comes Netflix to scoop up the rights before anyone else even had a chance. I couldn’t help but wonder: was going straight to streaming a vote of confidence in the film—or  a cop out ? A bit of both, I can finally say after seeing the film. And probably the right play. </p>

<p>As a consumer (especially one who’s house-bound with two kids), I selfishly applaud the move. The fact that Cary Joji Fukanaga’s follow up film after <em>True Detective</em> didn’t make the Cannes cut certainly didn’t dampen my expectations (especially since the whiff of being an “original Netflix film” may have been too odorous for those upturned French noses), and it was certainly one of the films I hoped to see at the Toronto International Film Festival. But that pending release date, a month later, which would be beamed straight to my home, pushed the film lower on my list of priorities. Which means that I saw the film, like most people, only after it was released to the public. And that’s when the whole distribution strategy started to make sense.</p>

<p>First, the film has a fairly difficult running time of 2 hours and 20 minutes, which is fine for superheroes and sequels, but not so much for films focused on child murder and rape. Though to scare people off with the film’s more extreme elements would be doing it a serious disservice. After all, Fukanaga’s cinematography (yeah, he did that, too, on top of writing and producing the film) has a poetic ease that never aims to shock, even in its most brutal machete-wielding moments. The performances are nicely underplayed, and Elba comes to the role of the Commandant with a certain <em>je ne sais quoi</em> that doesn’t quite demonize his reprehensible character. He treats the brutal violence around him as an avoidable consequence of refusing to follow his rules. </p>

<p>While the film may not have many direct comparisons, it’s probably most easily described as a cross between <em>The Last King of Scotland</em> and <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/10/5/war-witch-rebelle.html"><em>War Witch</em></a>—neither of which were exactly box-office champions, but both of which made an impact come Oscar season. </p>

<p>In some ways, <em>Beasts of No Nation</em> is destined to suffer a similar fate: it will either be heralded by critics, awards juries, and audiences who are able to see it more easily than the other buzzed-about end-of-year art films, or it will be consciously scrolled over in favour of a hundred other choices that are a little easier for the public to digest. </p>

<p>For your sake, I hope they press play.</p>
