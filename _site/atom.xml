    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Not all heroes wear capes. But in this case, it definitely helps. </p>

<p>As you’ll see, we wanted to include superheroes in our <strong>Greatest Movies A-Z</strong> series with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg">WatchMojo</a>. But pulling it off required some creativity. Did we save your favourite movie?  </p>

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="624" height="351" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F_P3LFGi47U?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>As you see, we played by the same set of rules as all the other videos:</p>

<ol>
<li>One film per letter</li>
<li>Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)</li>
<li>Final list should encapsulate the genre</li>
</ol>

<p>In this case, that last point meant not making this video an unofficial extension of the Marvel Cinematic Universe. So not every Avenger made the cut, especially when there was a solid alternative. </p>

<p>The bigger question here was what makes something a superhero movie? We didn’t create hard-and-fast rules like we did for sci-fi. But it’s safe to say these films all at least take place in a “superhero” world, even if the hero isn’t the protagonist. </p>

<p>Now here’s what we learned, and why we ultimately decided to make a couple jokes rather than actually cheat. </p>

<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM SUPERHERO A-Z</p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-superhero/top-decade.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>TOP DECADE: 2010s</strong><br />
        Obviously. Half the movies in this video are from the last 10 years. The oldest movie on here is from 1989. You’re welcome, Internet. </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-superhero/hardest-letter.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>HARDEST LETTER: B</strong><br />
          <em>Black Panther</em> fans probably have a right to be mad. The movie was nominated for Best Picture and is the highest grossing solo superhero film. Not to mention what it means to have a black superhero. Which also made it hard for <em>Blade 2</em> to compete. In the end, we went with another man in black, because you can’t deny what Tim Burton’s original movie did for the genre.
    </p>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">

    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>The New Mutants</em></strong><br />
        Thanks to COVID-19, we haven’t had a chance to see <em>The New Mutants</em> yet. So <em>No Ordinary Hero</em> wins on a technicality. A big technicality. <em>No Ordinary Hero</em> is technically about superheroes, but not a “real” superhero. It’s about a <em>real</em> superhero. Or at least a guy who plays a superhero on TV but then has to become one, of sorts. Anyway, take your victory lap <em>No Ordinary Hero</em>! We could have done a third freeze-frame with the wrong <em>Nightcrawler</em>, but if there was a movie that qualified, we had to use it.

    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>Spider-Man 2</em> vs <em>Superman</em></strong><br />
        I mean, we know who would win in a real fight, but when it comes to movies? Damn, it was close. Having a movie from the 70s sure would have felt good - especially something as beloved as the original <em>Superman</em>. But no Spidey?? We couldn’t do it. And Ebert agreed Spider-Man was the best superhero movie of all-time, so there.

    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>Joker</em></strong><br />
         Don’t get up our asses and say that <em>Joker</em> isn’t really a superhero movie. It’s the story of a villain in a superhero world. And considering the competition - <em>Justice League</em> and <em>Jonah Hex</em> - any arguments against <em>Joker</em> are going to feel pretty petty. But go ahead, we’re ready for it.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>We’re hoping the hardcore among you will come to our rescue when people see what we’ve done to this list.</p>

<p>This instalment of the <strong>Greatest Movies A-Z</strong> with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg">WatchMojo</a> includes ground rules for what we call “sci-fi”. We’re taking the “science” term more literally than some, trying to seperate space fantasy from true visions of the future, or science run amok. Take a look, and let’s talk. </p>

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="624" height="351" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/_v4ZiuN7BeU?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>As you see, we had two sets of rules this time. One that applies to all videos:</p>

<ol>
<li>One film per letter</li>
<li>Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)</li>
<li>Final list should encapsulate the genre</li>
</ol>

<p>And one that’s unique to defining the genre of Sci-Fi:</p>

<ol>
<li>Humans come from Earth</li>
<li>Earth-based monsters are created by scientists</li>
<li>No ghosts or magic</li>
</ol>

<p>Why did we do it? Well, for one, we have a lot of videos coming out. Tomorrow is Superheroes, and so we didn’t want to deal with Marvel movies in this one. And by actually defining sci-fi, <em>Star Wars</em> became a casualty. An even worse “offender” of hardcore sci-fi rules, in some cases. Most humans in Marvel movies are from earth, but not all. Earth doesn’t even exist in <em>Star Wars</em>. The next rule helps us differentiate between Frankenstein and Dracula, or King Kong and (the original) Godzilla. There are important distinctions that give those characters different meanings, even if they can lazily all be called “monsters”. And the last rule basically takes us away from the supernatural, even when science is involved (sorry,<em>Ghostbusters</em>). But also, it reinforces why the Star Wars universe (with the force) and Marvel movies (with mystics) aren’t truly sci-fi films.</p>

<p>Got it? Good! Now here’s some take-aways from the rest of our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission.</p>

<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM SCI-FI A-Z</p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-sci-fi/top-decade.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>TOP DECADE: 1980s</strong><br />
        A little surprising, but that’s definitely the way it shook out. New technology introduced in the 70s definitely gave the genre increased legitimacy, leading to a lot of classic films that still set the gold standard today - from visionary epics (<em>Blade Runner</em>), to beloved family films (<em>E.T.</em> and <em>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</em>), to critical darlings (<em>The Fly</em>) and franchise peaks (_Star Trek II_… and, just for good measure, consider that other franchise peak that didn’t qualify).
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-sci-fi/hardest-letter.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>HARDEST LETTER: C</strong><br />
          K was actually the hardest for the wrong reasons (<em>horrible</em> options), but in terms of being spoiled with choice, C was probably the biggest doozy. We actually jumped on board pretty quick once we agreed <em>A Clockwork Orange</em> qualified, but it came at the expense of <em>Close Encounters of the Third Kind</em>, <em>Contact</em>, <em>Children of Men</em>, <em>Cube</em>... all movies more readily considered classic sci-fi. But we cut Kubrick from horror, and <em>2001: A Space Odyssey</em> doesn’t start with a letter, so be damned if we were going to deny him here. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-sci-fi/cheated-out.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>The Road Warrior</em></strong><br />
         Obviously we should say <em>Star Wars</em> was the real movie cheated out (or <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>), but we explained that choice earlier. For <em>Mad Max 2:</em> <em>The Road Warrior</em>, we first debated if it would be M or R, since the movie was first released in the U.S. simply as <em>The Road Warrior</em>. If we went with R (where we were leaning), it was up against another cult classic from the same era. But we ultimately plan to represent the Mad Max series in another genre, so when that video eventually comes, we will finally sleep at night. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-sci-fi/best-battle.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>Alien</em> vs <em>Aliens</em></strong><br />
        We did this to ourselves. Had we used <em>Alien</em> in horror, we could have put <em>Aliens</em> in sci-fi and called it a day. But we didn’t, and it has been ripping us from the inside out ever since. We’ll find a way to make-good with a future video. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin:4rem 0;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-sci-fi/special-consideration.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>Honey, I Shrunk the Kids</em></strong><br />
         Most serious critics would have gone with <em>Her</em> here, but not us. No sir. We took a stand against all those depressed and depraved visions of technology to reflect the good, clean fun you can have with the genre.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>It may not have the same rabid following as Horror, Sci-Fi and Animation, but the crime genre does have one thing going for it - some of the best movies ever made. </p>

<p>In doing this <strong>Greatest Movies A-Z</strong> series with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg">WatchMojo</a>, it would have been a crime to skip the genre responsible for so much incredible and important cinema. Some movies ended up getting whacked we would have never expected, but you can’t go against the family - or the rules of the alphabet. Enjoy. </p>

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="624" height="351" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/F_P3LFGi47U?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>Again, we gave ourselves some guidelines:</p>

<ol>
<li>One film per letter</li>
<li>Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)</li>
<li>Final list should encapsulate the genre</li>
</ol>

<p>The last rule dictated a lot of our hardest decisions. We also, as always, strived for balance when it came down to a pissing contest over what film was the “best”.</p>

<p>So here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission. </p>

<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM CRIME A-Z</p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-crime/top-decade.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>TOP DECADE: 1990s</strong><br />
        Your gut probably tells you it will be the 70s. Based on this list, it’s almost the 50s. But in the end the 90s proved the most prolific decade for greatest crime movies. And it’s not like they claimed easy letters. We dare you to disagree with any of those 90s spots.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-crime/hardest-letter.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>HARDEST LETTER: T</strong><br />
          <em>Taxi Driver</em> is not on this list. Neither is <em>Touch of Evil</em>. Nor <em>Traffic.</em> Scorsese got M instead (taking it away from <em>The Maltese Falcon</em>, <em>Memento,</em> and even Fritz Lang’s <em>M</em>) since he really couldn’t expect to take G - even if <em>Goodfellas</em> is hellagood. It’s a deal with the devil, but we played by eye-for-an-eye rules (or, in this case, T-for-a-G)
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-crime/cheated-out.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>The Departed</em></strong><br />
        We went with <em>Infernal Affairs</em>, the Hong Kong movie it’s based on, instead. Yes it helped us make the list less American-centric, but it’s also pretty defensible if you’ve seen that original trilogy. We kind of double-screwed Scorsese though, since it meant we also didn’t give him <em>The Irishman</em>. That’s the real I-for-an-I!
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-crime/best-battle.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>The Night Hunter</em> vs <em>No Country for Old Men</em></strong><br />
        Just brutal, we know. We might as well have flipped a coin. But Anton Chigurh bit the dust. What’s the most you ever lost on a coin toss?
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin:4rem 0;width:100%;">

    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>Uncut Gems</em></strong><br />
         We were thrilled that <em>Queen and Slim</em> not only gave us a 2019 movie, but a good one. U was not as straightforward. The 90s were already very well represented, but we easily could have gone with <em>The Usual Suspects</em>. Or even <em>The Untouchables</em>. But in the end, we went with the greatest trick Adam Sandler ever pulled - convincing us he deserves to exist (as a serious actor).

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>No one is really a fan of war itself, but films <em>about</em> war? That&#39;s another story.</p>

<p>This is the second video in our <strong>Greatest Movies A-Z</strong> series with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg">WatchMojo</a>, and it opens with a bang. Many of the other films are less obvious, but equally glorious (and/or horrifying), so strap in.</p>

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="624" height="351" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B5XQYYw-44w?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<li>One film per letter</li>
<li>Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)</li>
<li>Final list should encapsulate the genre</li>
</ol>

<p>The last rule dictated a lot of our hardest decisions. It also made for some heated debates, which only barely avoided becoming all-out fights. </p>

<p>(Don’t worry. Cooler heads prevailed. Even if that goes against the spirit of the genre.)</p>

<p>So here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission.</p>

<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM WAR A-Z</p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-war/top-decade.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>TOP DECADE: 1960s</strong><br />
        Objectively, the 1960s just have the most films on our list (even if <em>X-15</em> is more about test pilots and the space race than actual war). But most of the others are iconic and run the full spectrum of the war genre, from terrifying, to rousing, to epics, to even a musical. The decade redefined the genre. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-war/hardest-letter.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>HARDEST LETTER: B</strong><br />
        Depending on your age, the first “B” movie you probably think of in the war genre is <em>The</em> <em>Bridge on the River Kwai</em> or <em>Black Hawk Down</em>. Or you could definitely argue for <em>Braveheart</em> (we stuck to modern war, even if we didn’t state that as a rule). They’re all A+ movies (not B-movies!) for different reasons. But <em>The Battle of Algiers</em> is still one of the most impressive films ever made. The White House actually screened it for Generals before invading Iraq to help them understand modern warfare. If you haven’t seen it, go watch it. Now!<br />
        <br />
        (Also, P and D were bloodbaths to argue between in their own right)
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-war/cheated-out.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>Valkyrie</em></strong><br />
        It probably should be on the list. It’s definitely more classically a “war” movie than <em>Victory</em>. The only reason it isn’t here, honestly, is because we used it on our very first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6vHljlgQsU"><em>Action Movies A-Z</em></a> before we changed the format of the videos. We didn’t want to repeat ourselves. But if this new series goes well, we'll probably redo Action anyway, and then really seem like fools.

        <strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>The Great Escape</em> <strong>vs</strong> <em>Grand Illusion</em></strong><br />
        This one hurt. <em>Grand Illusion</em> was the first-ever release of the Criterion Collection. It’s a renowned piece of humanist anti-war filmmaking, which continues to age incredibly well. But it’s not Steve McQueen on a motorbike, and our dads would never speak to us again if it wasn’t included.

         It’s here because it’s devastating and underseen. Know what’s <em>not</em> underseen or on this list? <em>Casablanca</em>. Plenty of people will call it a war film, but come on. That’s not the shelf you’re going to find <em>Casablanca</em> on at the video store. You still go to the video store, right?

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Who knew debates over the best animated films of all-time would get so…. animated?</p>

<p>As we continue our <strong>Greatest Movies A-Z</strong> series with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg">WatchMojo</a>, we made sure to draw from a long history of classic animation feature films. EWven though for this first season we are focusing on genres, and animation is a medium, it’s a category we just couldn’t ignore. Enjoy. </p>

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="624" height="351" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/gPBwj6mD-Qg?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>Again, we gave ourselves some guidelines:</p>

<ol>
<li>One film per letter</li>
<li>Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)</li>
<li>Final list should encapsulate the genre</li>
</ol>

<p>The last rule dictated a lot of our hardest decisions. We also had to ignore certain “outdated cultural stereotypes” at times to focus instead on the larger cultural impact. </p>

<p>So here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission. </p>

<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM ANIMATION A-Z</p>

<p>Now that this first video is out, here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission. </p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
        <img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-animation/top-decade.jpg"> 
    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>TOP DECADE: 00s</strong><br />
        It makes sense that the decade which saw the introduction of an Oscar category for Best Animated Feature is when the medium really started to flourish. Pixar changed the game, taking the shine off Disney’s new golden era (until Disney gobbled Pixar up, too), while Anime surged in popularity. DOn’t sleep on the 90sl of course. And ‘88 alone gave us three Toho masterpieces - how does that happen??
    </p>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">

    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>HARDEST LETTER: S</strong><br />
        The default here would have been to go with the O.G. Disney classic <em>Snow White and the Seven Dwarfs</em>. Recency bias would put <em>Spider-man: Into the Spiderverse</em> ahead of the pack. And nostalgia could have carried <em>Shrek</em> right to the top. Hell, even <em>South Park: Bigger, Longer, Uncut</em> would compete in almost any other letter. Instead, we had to go with what many consider Hayao Miyazaki’s masterpiece, <em>Spirited Away</em>.
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">

    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>Fantastic Mr. Fox</em></strong><br />
        They probably won’t be the most vocal corner of the Internet, but it’s impossible to deny the _Frozen-_heads and what that film did for Disney’s 20-year drought of creating a true animated classic. Sorry, Wes.

    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>Toy Story</em> <strong>vs</strong> <em>Toy Story 3</em></strong><br />
        If you accept that one of the Toy Story movies has to make the list (and yes, accept it!), then it really comes down to which one. You could easily argue any of the four films, but <em>Toy Story 3</em> has the most convincing track-record to compete (between box-office, Oscar nominations, and general love). Still, we went with the original. Not only is it a great film, but it made computer animation acceptable - beloved, even. Those kind of innovations are a nice tie-breaker.

    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>Persepolis</em></strong><br />
    Anime junkies will argue for <em>Princess Mononoke</em> here, while Disney die-hards often consider <em>Pinocchio</em> to be Walt’s early-era masterpiece. But <em>Persepolis</em> is an excellent and important film not made by the two titans of animation that definitely deserves a place in the conversation of greatest animated films of all-time.

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Making a video about the greatest comedies of all time is serious stuff. Well, we took it seriously, anyway. </p>

<p>This is the second instalment in our <strong>Greatest Movies A-Z</strong> series with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg">WatchMojo</a>, and it might have been the hardest of all. As tempting as it is to just stick to Will Farrell movies that make us laugh, we had the whole history of cinema to contend with. A rich, hilarious history which we hope this video serves as a nice reminder. Enjoy. </p>

<li>Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)</li>
<li>Final list should encapsulate the genre</li>
</ol>

<p>The last rule dictated a lot of our hardest decisions. Sometimes you have to go with beloved movies even if you don’t personally love them (looking at you, <em>Caddyshack</em>). </p>

<p>So here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission.</p>

<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM COMEDY A-Z</p>

<p>Now that this first video is out, here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission. </p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">

    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>TOP DECADE: 1980s</strong><br />
        The 1980s have the most films on the list, suggesting some generational bias. The 70s and 90s are also well represented. The last 20 years have it rough: there’s not a single movie here from the 2010s. They just don’t make ‘em like they used to! And by that, we mean in the 20s and 30s (it’s not nostalgia - those movies we included are <em>still</em> great).
    </p>

    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>HARDEST LETTER: G</strong><br />
        G, didn’t expect that! If a Charlie Chaplin vs Buster Keaton face-off wasn’t enough (<em>The Great Dictator</em> vs <em>The General</em>), what about the 1-2 punch of Bill Murray’s all-time classics <em>Groundhog Day</em> and <em>Ghostbusters</em>? Or maybe we meet halfway in the timeline with <em>Gentlemen Prefer Blondes</em>? Instead, we played some politics, giving Keaton the G film and pushing <em>Groundhog Day</em> to another genre, and having Marilyn Monroe “settle” for the still pitch perfect comedy <em>Some Like it Hot</em>. <em>Ghostbusters</em> just didn’t make the call of a pure comedy - it’s so much more.<br />
        <br />
        <strong>Runner-up: A</strong>. <em>Anchorman</em> vs <em>Ace Ventura</em> vs <em>Austin Powers</em> - come on!<br />
        <br />
        <strong>2nd Runner-up: B.</strong> <em>Blazing Saddles</em> vs <em>The Big Lebowski</em> vs _Bridesmaids_… see why we said this genre was the hardest??</p>

    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>Lost in America</em></strong><br />
        It’s a Criterion Collection comedy (which is pretty rare), and just a hell of a funny ride. But the video was getting a little bro-centric. Even though Reese Witherspoon double dips with <em>Election</em>, <em>Legally Blonde</em> was just too big and beloved not to recognize.

    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>Wayne’s World</em> <strong>vs</strong> <em>What’s Up, Doc?</em></strong><br />
        Wayne and Garth would probably claim they aren’t worthy of taking out screen queen Barbara Streisand in <em>What’s Up, Doc?</em>, but _Wayne’s World_really holds up. Still, we banged our heads against the wall for a while, then just went with our gut. Asphinctersayswhat?

    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>Dumb and Dumber</em></strong><br />
        You’re either thinking <em>hell yes!</em> this movie made the cut, or <em>what the hell</em>? The film snob in us definitely fought for <em>Dr. Strangelove or How I Learned to Stop Worrying and Love the Bomb</em>. The film historian part of our brain mounted a solid argument for the Marx Brothers’ <em>Duck Soup</em>. But at the risk of our pets losing their heads, we just had to respect the biggest comedy star of the 90s in one of the dumbest, funniest movies of a generation

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>You know what’s really scary? Committing to a list of the all-time best horror films. </p>

<p>As the first video in our new Greatest Movies A-Z series with <a href="https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg">WatchMojo</a>, we knew it wouldn’t be easy. That doesn’t mean we knew it would be so hard. But here it is:</p>

<div class="video-container"><iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/TsZ1naZczHc?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

<p>As you can see, we gave ourselves some guidelines:</p>

<ol>
<li>One film per letter</li>
<li>Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)</li>
<li>Final list should encapsulate the genre</li>
</ol>

<p>The last rule dictated a lot of our hardest decisions. And we’re confident with where we ended up - especially after a last minute change to replace <em>Killer Klowns from Outer Space</em> with <em>King Kong</em>. </p>

<p>(Seriously. We almost forgot <em>King Kong</em> was a horror movie. That would have gotten ugly).</p>

<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM HORROR A-Z</p>

<p>Now that this first video is out, here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission. </p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">

    </div>
    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>TOP DECADE: 1970s</strong><br />
        Nine of our choices come from the 70s. Every one of them has a sequel and/or remake. The decade really set the template for modern horror. 
    </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">

        <strong>HARDEST LETTER: P</strong><br />
        <em>Paranormal Activity</em>. <em>Poltergeist</em>. <em>The Purge<em>. </em>Pet Cemetary</em>.  All extremely successful and important to the genre, but they ultimately have to bow down to the mother of mainstream horror: <em>Psycho</em>.
    </p>

    <div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">

    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>Alien</em></strong><br />
        Is <em>Alien</em> a horror movie? Sure. But it fit better in another genre, so we didn’t even consider it here. Don’t worry, we can hear you scream. 
    </p>

    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>Scream</em> vs <em>The Shining</em></strong><br />
        If you think we’re crazy for not going with Kubrick, trust us, we know. <em>The Shining</em> is a bona fide classic, and has had a real cultural resurgence since <em><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/4/9/room-237.html">Room 237</a></em>, <em><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2018/4/3/ready-player-one.html">Ready Player One</a></em>, and <em><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2019/11/12/doctor-sleep.html">Doctor Sleep</a></em>. But <em>Scream</em> single-handedly rejuvenated the horror genre in the mid 90s. It spawned three sequels, countless imitators, and even a spoof series (<em>Scary Movie</em>) that got all the way to a fifth instalment. Not to mention how the original <em>Scream</em> still totally slaps as a horror movie. The best argument against it might be that we already have a Wes Craven film in <em>Nightmare on Elm Street</em>. But like <em>Scream</em>, we just had to play with the rules here.

    <p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
        <strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>The Wizard of Gore</em></strong><br />
        Is it really better than <em><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/2/19/the-witch.html
">The Witch</a></em>? Probably not, but we had to throw some love at the buckets-of-blood king Herschell Gordon Lewis. Helped us round out the style of horror films on the list, too.

    <link rel="alternate" type="text/html" href="/content/2020/3/4/the-invisible-man.html/?utm_source=RSS&amp;utm_medium=RSS&amp;utm_campaign=TheInvisibleMan" />

    <id>/content/2020/3/4/the-invisible-man</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>No one obsesses over someone’s invisible movements as much as you do. It’s your job to anticipate where someone could be and remember all their previous steps in order to see the full picture, even when others can’t. All made possible by some fancy new cameras.</p>

<p>Maybe Elisabeth Moss was stalking <em>you</em> in preparation for this role.  </p>

<p>Moss’s character in <em>The Invisible Man</em> is the victim of an abusive ex-boyfriend who gets inside her head, and eventually, her bedroom, without anyone else understanding how he could be so ever-present in her life. This is a Blumhouse thriller, not a purely psychological drama, so the villain is also a world-leading optics pioneer capable of such (literal) invisible stalking. But science is the last thing on writer and director Leigh Whanell’s mind. He made a genre film with an agenda. Basically, <em>It Follows</em> so <em>Get Out</em> of <em>A Quiet Place</em>. And <em>The Invisible Man</em> actually belongs in the conversation with those titans of new wave horror. </p>

<p>While you were tracking technical details, making sure that shots stitch together and track character movement, Whanell’s script has its sights set on the big picture. As a result, <em>The Invisible Man</em> is the first truly great film sprung from the #MeToo movement (apologies to <em>Bombshell</em>, <em>The Assistant</em>, <em>Support the Girls</em>, et al.). It delivers all the visceral suspense and thrills one expects from this type of outing, with a healthy dose of the female glare (what I’ll call the distrustful reaction to the infamous “male gaze”). By locking the audience&#39;s perspective to that of the victim, we experience first-person terror that feels miles apart from the pervy voyeur-o-vision we’ve come to expect from <em>Hollow Man</em> or the Translucent anti-superhero from “The Boys” TV series. It’s not just refreshing in a politically woke sense, it’s actually more effective as a film.</p>

<p>Much to your delight, I&#39;m sure, (and mine) the film isn’t trying to impress anyone with a floating fedora and sunglasses. Enough is withheld visually to almost believe, for a while, that maybe Moss’s character is going over the deep end, paranoid without real justification. The title of the film, of course, vindicates her from the start, but Whanell doesn’t let that prevent us from experiencing some skepticism ourselves as she seems to unravel. Until, of course, the shark comes out of the water and she has to face the terror head on.</p>

<p>In fact, the final act of the film proves as adept of an accomplishment in action filmmaking as the early part of the film is patient and deceptive with negative space. This transition in filmmaking styles doesn’t seem like it should work, but in practice it is wildly effective. I guess sometimes you just have to see to believe.</p>
