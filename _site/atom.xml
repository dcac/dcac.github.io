    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Set medics are often seen as a precaution. On a good day, you shouldn’t have anything to do. Actors and stunt workers play their scenes and leave unscathed. You pack up your stethoscope and purple latex gloves and walk off into the sunset. But in <em>The Finest Hours</em>, you’re not just a precaution—you’re a necessity.  </p>

<p><em>The Finest Hours</em> is, for the most part, a disaster movie. It’s the true story of the heroic 1952 rescue of 32 seamen aboard the SS Pendleton, which was led by Bernie Webber and his ragtag crew. It was mission that has gone down in U.S. Coast Guard history as the single greatest small boat rescue ever attempted; a severe storm crippled the SS Pendleton, leaving the coast guards no choice but to brave aggressive waves that threatened to tear their 36-foot motorboat into pieces. Their chances of survival were slim to none. </p>

<p>To recreate this harrowing affair, you and the cast of <em>The Finest Hours</em>  endured weeks of filming in what seems to have been a <a href="http://www.king5.com/story/entertainment/television/programs/evening/2016/01/29/who-got-wettest-behind-scenes-finest-hours/79487252/">watery hell</a>. Your days began and ended in a massive 800,000-gallon water tank, and the cast was drenched in ice-cold water while they acted out their scenes; a torrential downpour blasted from a fire-hose. That kind of exposure to cold temperatures can take a toll on the human body, and, as the set medic, it was your job to make sure nobody fell ill during the shoot. You had to be prepared with the proper equipment and ready to jump into action the moment the director yelled cut. If a pivotal performer got injured or fell sick, production would halt. I can imagine it was a very difficult task, especially with such a huge cast, so you could probably relate to the long odds and seemingly insurmountable task that the rescuers in the film faced. </p>

<p>I was impressed how director Craig Gillespie was able to capture the desperate strain on the protagonists’ faces. I certainly didn’t get the sense that the film’s stars, Chris Pine, Casey Affleck, Ben Foster, etc, were sitting back and relaxing while their stunt-doubles accepted all the on-screen punishment. </p>

<p>Not to say the stunt doubles didn’t have their own troubles. To mimic the ragdoll motions of bluejackets being tossed around in an oil tanker, <em>The Finest Hours</em> stunt team look like they were launching themselves against iron walls and metal grates. They weren’t being ravaged by the sea, but instead, the vessel itself. How often did they have to check in to the McPeake clinic over the course of shooting? More than a few times, I’ll bet.</p>

<p>As exhausting as this must have been for you and the rest of the cast and crew, the events depicted in <em>The Finest Hours</em> are riveting. It’s one of Hollywood’s more recent disaster-themed action-adventures that I’ve been able to enjoy. That speaks volumes when you take the large, CGI waves into consideration. Too much CGI has a tendency to strip away any real sense of danger—but not this time. <em>The Finest Hours</em> carefully balances CGI and authenticity to deliver a solid end product. The moment the first crack tears its way through the bow of the SS Pendleton’s reinforced walls, I was hooked. </p>

<p>And a lot of that was thanks to your presence on the set. You were able to create a safe environment in which the performers could push themselves to the limit and bring a striking realism to the screen. And for that, I thank you.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Your family name, “Lax”, would be ironic in any profession where attention to detail is essential to the job. In your case, you might over-compensate by vigilantly triple-checking every ledger, just to make sure no one can accuse you of succumbing to your careless moniker. Or you might go the other way, embracing your brand so hard (by becoming, say, a well-known amoral number cruncher), that the combination of title and purpose seems predestined. You know, like discovering that some Wall Street traders bet on the collapse of the entire financial system and made out like bandits.</p>

<p>Herein lies the central narrative for <em>The Big Short</em>. Based on the true events of a handful of outsiders who saw the mortgage housing meltdown coming and banked its collapse, we get an oddball story told with such untethered glee that it’s impossible not to get caught up in the crazy. No small feat considering the unsexy source material. </p>

<p>See, the whole vocabulary of the banking system might be second nature to people like you, but its intellectual anesthesia for the rest of us. So of course we’re happy to play along when Margo Robbie spells something out for us in a bubble bath, or Anthony Bourdain chops up a tasty metaphor. These are the types of flourishes that help elevate <em>The Big Short</em> from just another straight forward drama or low-brow comedy, into a rousing genre-bending piece of entertainment.</p>

<p>The mad man behind the camera, Adam Mackay, directs every scene with the careless confidence of a high-rolling hedge fund manager. He knows he has A-list stars to spare, which allows him to be almost reckless in their treatment. Christian Bale leans hard into his glass eye for maximum eccentricity. Ryan Gosling smooth talks directly into the camera with excessive smarm. Steve Carell seethes in every scene, waiting for any chance to go off. Brad Pitt mumbles life-changing advice from behind his financial- guru beard. Then there’s his visual approach which uses every trick in the book – zooms, flares, flash frames, stock footage, smash cuts, breaking the fourth wall – and you’ve got either the recipe for a filmmaking disaster, or a longshot success. </p>

<p>Well, cha ching.</p>

<p><em>The Big Short</em> believes in its approach and capitalizes on the chances it takes. The subject matter is serviced thoroughly without ever sacrificing a laugh. It’s a rare example of being both creative and responsible to your shareholders – in this case, the audience – who have put their money and confidence in the returns being promised. For once, the laugh isn’t being had at our expense.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>I’m going to guess that you’re sisters, around six and eight. The woman you walked in with was most likely your mother, and the three of you arrived just as the film was about to start. You sat beside a man who was most likely your father. </p>

<p>I’ve seen this kind of thing before at free screenings. A movie with puppets, or teddy bears, or animation seems like a fun mid-week treat. A cheap night out for the family. Until the bear starts smoking weed and swearing, or the puppets start touching each other in their bathing suit areas and the next thing you know, the kids are being dragged out of the theatre, a trail of popcorn behind them.</p>

<p>But you stayed. And saw things and heard things that you likely hadn’t seen or heard before. I know I did. I went in expecting <em>Anomalisa</em>, a stop-motion animated film by Charlie Kaufman, to be dark and bizarre and a little sardonic. I’m not sure what <em>you</em> expected, but by the end of the film you probably had more questions than answers. I spent several hours afterwards trying to dissect what I’d just seen. And I’m a grown-up. </p>

<p>In most kid’s movies, the protagonist is the hero of the story, someone to look up to, someone to root for. Not so here. Michael Stone, the semi-famous customer service guru who has arrived Cincinnati for a seminar, is kind of an asshole (I don’t feel bad swearing in front of you; not after what we’ve been through). The first lines of dialogue in the film use the f-word liberally as Michael reads a letter from a jilted lover. Soon after that, Michael urinates in his hotel bathroom, takes a shower, and visits a sex shop. Probably not the type of stuff you’re used to seeing on <em>Sesame Street</em> or <em>Treehouse</em>. But hey, now you know that the thing you found in Mummy’s bedside table isn’t a flashlight like she told you.</p>

<p>I don’t have kids myself, but I remember being pretty perceptive when I was your age. Did you <em>also</em> notice that Michael constantly misses opportunities to make genuine, human connections with the people around him? Or that everyone he interacts with looks and sounds the same? The figures used in the film have faces that are attached like masks, and with the exception of David Thewlis, who voices Michael, and Jennifer Jason-Leigh, who voices Lisa, the only other actor in the film is Tom Noonan, who voices everyone else. Even you guys probably picked up on the fact that this is meant to reflect Michael’s view of the world as mundane, lacking variety and joy. Everyone around him moves through their lives like mindless automatons. And although he has a wife and son at home, and a successful career, he mopes about like a put-upon, spoiled, petulant child. </p>

<p>When Michael finally cajoles his ex-lover to visit him in the hotel bar, we see just how selfish and narcissistic he is. His attempts to force intimacy result in his eventual meeting with Lisa, who he is attracted to because she doesn’t look or sound like anyone else. She’s an <em>anomaly</em>. Get it? Lisa is sweet, and self-deprecating, and though she is scarred both physically and emotionally, she is real. It’s this realness that mesmerizes Michael. Jennifer Jason Leigh’s portrayal of Lisa is the bright spot in this dull world. She sings Cyndi Lauper, reveals her joys and fears, and allows Lisa some bravery in her vulnerability. </p>

<p>Little girls often make their dolls do inappropriate things. But I’m fairly certain you’ve never done to your dolls what Michael does to Lisa. Instead of playing the sex scenes for laughs like <em>Team America: World Police</em>, Kaufman and co-director Duke Johnson take care to present the (anatomically correct) sex between Michael and Lisa as honestly and lovingly as possible. Just remember kids, oral sex is only for puppets who think they love each other very, very much. But because this is a Kaufman movie, I knew better than to expect a happily ever after ending. Even a child could see that Lisa, in all her Middle-American ordinariness, is too good for Michael.</p>

<p>For all its naturalism and attention to detail, the conceit of 
<em>Anomalisa</em>, though beautifully executed, smacks of gimmickry. In the end, we’re left with a mediocre Charlie Kaufman oddity that feels like more like an extended therapy session than a story. The themes of isolation and mid-life identity crisis are a little on the nose, especially when Michael’s customer service advice (“Look for what is special about each individual, focus on that”) is juxtaposed against his inability to view people as different. See kids? That’s called irony! Then there were some headscratchers like a dream sequence that brought the pace of the story to a dead halt, and the fact that for some reason the film takes place in 2006, perhaps so Michael can go off on a George Bush rant in the middle of his conference speech. Kids, George Bush was the president before Obama, and he…oh, never mind.  </p>

<p>But I must commend you for sticking it out. Many, <em>many</em> adults walked out of the screening—more than I’ve ever seen leave a film before. Maybe they were expecting the strange wit of <em>Being John Malkovich</em>, or the bubble-gum visuals of <em>Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind,</em> or maybe they were expecting <em>Wallace &amp; Gromit</em>. Who knows. I was hoping for Kaufman’s trademark whimsical melancholy, that rare gift that allows him to consistently deliver movies that manage that balance between art and mainstream. <em>Anomalisa</em> almost gets the balance right, but like most kid’s puppet shows, between the kissing scenes and the fighting scenes, the story just isn’t all that interesting.</p>

<p>As I watched you walk down the aisle after the screening, one of you had obviously been crying. The other was staring straight ahead, clutching a box of Poptopia for dear life. I will remember <em>Anomalisa</em> as the only Charlie Kaufman movie that made me check my watch. I’m sure it will be memorable for you too, but for very different reasons. </p>

    <id>/content/2016/1/29/cartel-land</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>You’re one crazy sonofabitch, aren’t you? Embedding yourself with gun-toting mercenaries, meth cooks, and cartel members is not exactly a sane way to make a paycheque. The fact that director/producer/cinematographer/editor Matthew Heineman seems willing to put his life on the line is one thing – he gets all the final glory if things go right. But you’re just a hired gun (sorry, bad metaphor). I don’t exactly know which scenes you filmed, but whether it was State-side with armed minute-men hunting drug traffickers, or following a mini-revolution within Mexico, the chance of you getting shot before getting the shot you wanted seemed stupidly high. </p>

<p>But damn. What a hell of film.</p>

<p>There’s no shortage of movies about the U.S. government’s bloody war on drugs.  <em>Cartel Land,</em> however, ups the ante by actually going into the trenches with the foot soldiers who are either profiting from the chaos, or simply trying to protect their home. </p>

<p>The film starts off with a deceptively slow-pace, with drug producers being interviewed in an undisclosed desert location at night. The masked interviewee is calm, thoughtful and personable. He’s fully aware that the drugs they’re making in Mexico are ruining people’s lives, but he’s also fairly unapologetic about his participation. After all, he’s out of options. This humanizing introduction is an important touch that I thought back on a lot over the course of the film, especially when horror stories are relayed about how the cartels take over small towns. One woman in particular goes into gory detail about the ways the cartel assert their control over the population by brutally murdering not only men and women, but infants and children. Thank God you didn’t capture any of that.</p>

<p>But you do come pretty close, especially during a climactic raid by the Autodefensas – a paramilitary group trying to reclaim one cartel-run Mexican town at a time. The shoot-out is so intense that I had to remind myself this was a documentary. People’s lives are at risk – including yours – during the sequence of events. It was the most breathtaking scene I’ve watched all year. </p>

<p>The visuals throughout the film are powerful, with beautiful compositions not only during the less intense transitional moments, but also when you’re under fire. How you guys managed to keep your trigger fingers operating a zoom lens while bullets are whizzing by, or while people are being interrogated at gun point, is a truly compelling feat of cinematography.   </p>

<p>Heinman’s approach totally immerses the audience in the chaos. There are no voiceovers to tie together the different stories we’re following, and no convenient confrontation linking the subjects together. They are just two sides of the same coin, making up the complicated cross-border battlefront of the drug war that most of us are blessedly removed from. You helped bring it into our lives in a very real way.</p>

<p>Stay safe, man.</p>

    <id>/content/2016/1/26/tangerine</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>In an <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iSePbQVR284">interview</a> for the 1991 documentary <em>Hearts of Darkness</em> (which I can’t recommend enough) Francis Ford Coppola describes the future of film making in this short sentence: </p>

<p>“<em>One day, some little fat girl in Ohio is going to be the new Mozart and make a beautiful film.</em>”</p>

<p><em>Tangerine</em> is that film. Which means, I guess, you’re the chubby new Mozart from Ohio.*  </p>

<p>Shot guerilla style on modified iPhone 5’s, <em>Tangerine</em> is a ludicrously exciting film, and a perfect example of how you can do something really interesting if you know how to compose a frame and tell a story. That the performances are uneven, or that the production values are utterly low rent, doesn’t detract from what is, in its finished state, a remarkable movie. Those things that might seem to be shortcomings in larger budget films actually help to create, in a film like <em>Tangerine,</em> a world that is both neo-realist and still somehow dreamlike. </p>

<p>The story is simple. It follows one person (a weirdly engaging and still amateurish performance from the oh-so-aptly named Kitana Kiki Rodriguez) in her search for a wayward boyfriend. Along the way a whole collection of outré characters pop in and out of frame, but it’s how the story is told—a great soundtrack, imaginative and constantly invigorating camerawork, and a verite that comes from something so intimate and small scale—that makes it special.</p>

<p>Coppola, in the same 35-second segment, also talks about how this new kind of filmmaker will liberate the art form from the artificial constraints of what he brackets as “professionalism”.</p>

<p>I think what he means is fairly simple: once filmmaking becomes a process that only requires a few willing participants, a couple of iPhones, a good computer, and some innate talent, then the artform is taken out of the hands of people who are only concerned with the economics of the film business. It changes the balance of power, which means that executive producers and distributors, financiers and beancounters move to their proper place in the hierarchy. Because, while these people are clearly an important part of the process, they are important only <em>after</em> the fact.</p>

<p>Too often—at least up till now—the only time an artist has had the wherewithal to make the work they really want to make is after they have emptied whatever pool of real talent they possess. People like Christopher Nolan and Tarantino only achieved that kind of autonomy after years of negotiating the studio system which seems (to me) to have sucked them dry of what made films like <em>Reservoir Dogs</em> or <em>The Following</em> so vital and alive (although apparently that has not happened to George Miller—so maybe proximity to Hollywood is also part of the equation). All these revered auteurs seem capable of creating now are these bloated, over-wrought <em>productions</em>, that are long on surface concerns like the Imax sequences in <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em> or Tarantino’s 70mm roadshow for <em>The Hateful Eight</em> and short on what was so promising in their early works: a real engagement with storytelling and character.</p>

<p>The whole film industry seems on the edge of catastrophic changes and <em>Tangerine</em> is one of the harbingers of that welcome disaster. It’s an example—for anyone with the foresight to see—of what it’s possible to do with nothing more than a couple of jacked up iPhones and a good idea. </p>

<p>And, of course, prodigious talent as well.</p>

    <id>/content/2016/1/26/the-5th-wave</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Supporting roles are an interesting barometer—they can tell you a lot about the film as whole. If they are well rounded, interesting and memorable often times the rest of the movie follows suit. If they are forgettable, paper thin, and flaccid, chances are it will be difficult to avoid an inadvertent nap.</p>

<p>Suffice it to say, Ron, I left the <em>The 5th Wave</em> feeling unexpectedly well rested. </p>

<p>I have a real soft spot for you as an actor. Your folksy portrayal as “Nix” (often tinged with a hint of a pretty dark interior life) in <em>Band Of Brothers</em> really engaged me. Even a film as throwaway as <em>Office Space</em> was elevated by your quiet—and sort of weird—reverse charisma. It is as if the less you speak the more interesting you become. </p>

<p>Going into the screening of <em>The 5th Wave</em>—which according to the trailer I saw, looked like the best I could hope for was a cookie cutter dystopian narrative made with a kind of minimal competence (see: <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/9/22/maze-runner-the-scorch-trials.html"><em>Maze Runner: Scorch Trials</em></a> et al)—I was at least hoping I could lean on your performance as a something to keep me engaged.</p>

<p>Instead you got was about seven minutes of utterly forgettable screen time, and while you were building your second pool with the paycheck this film afforded you, I was left floundering with a film that was passionless, disinterested in its own premises, and often horribly miscast. How otherwise to explain another fine supporting actor like Liev Schreiber coming off even more rail thin and hollow than your portrayal as “The Dad” of Chloe Moretz’s turn at the Chosen One motif. </p>

<p>Sometimes films that generally aren’t that great have something that helps them rise above their own limitations. Last year’s <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/8/27/the-end-of-the-tour.html"><em>The End of The Tour</em> </a>(in which you also had a small part) was made greater than the sum of its parts partially on the strength of a supporting cast that included you, Joan Cusak, and Becky Anne Baker. But for that to happen, there has to be far more commitment and interest in the material than I got from anyone attached to this film—other than Moretz, who labored, unsuccessfully, to invest her character with something emotionally meaningful. </p>

<p>That <em>The 5th Wave</em> is largely a waste of its 38 million dollar budget obviously isn’t on your shoulders. The direction is workmanlike at best, the genre tropes are so tired that they may as well have just been written out on title cards—<em>obligatory montage where various plagues and disasters reduce the population to numbers our budget and capabilities can manage</em>. Even the visuals feel like mid-level FX network series quality.</p>

<p>But I suppose what I had hoped for was that your attachment to <em>The 5th Wave</em> meant perhaps the script, or even the performances, would somehow rise above the limitations of listless direction or poorly conceived genre tropes. Unfortunately, that was not the case.</p>

<p>I hope you at least enjoy the pool, Ron.</p>

    <id>/content/2016/1/22/svengali</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>There are three things the British do better than anyone else; comedy, satire, and junk food. John Hardwick’s <em>Svengali</em> attempts to cover the first two. The dangerous amount of Walkers cheese &amp; onion crisps and Rowntree’s Fruit Gums consumed while watching it (inadvisable, but <em>highly</em> recommended) speaks to my fondness for the third. </p>

<p>Adorable and amiable Welshman, Dixie, dreams of being a music manager, a ‘Svengali’ in the vein of Alan McGee and Tony Wilson. He moves to London with his unfailingly supportive girlfriend to manage a band he discovered on YouTube. Hardwick attempts to braid together three main narrative threads: a satire of the music business, a love story, and a small-town-boy-in-the-big-city tale, complete with the requisite archetypes including Mean, High-strung Boss and Asshole Foreign Landlady. It’s hard for me to say bad things about the film, but I also wish I had more emphatically <em>good</em> things to say about it. </p>

<p>Full disclosure: I am not cool when it comes to music. I don’t know bands, and have no idea what the kids are into these days. There are apparently quite a few clever cameos in the film, like some person from something called ‘The Libertines’, but it all went right over my head. You know how I mentioned ‘Svengalis in the vein of Alan McGee and Tony Wilson’ in the paragraph above? I had to google them for that sentence to make any sense. But even if you’re clueless and un-hip like me, you get that this is supposed to be a send-up of an industry filled with assholes. Except it isn’t – not entirely. For every asshole Dixie encounters, there is at least one very nice person who readily helps him out, or gives him a bit of encouragement. Things actually go so well for Dixie - from getting the band to make him their manager, to bringing attention to them as the next big thing - that the obstacles thrown into his path seem forced. Regardless, obstacles abound, but they end up throwing the narrative out of whack, and it becomes difficult to know where to pay attention. </p>

<p>At the beginning, the three narrative threads take turns pulling in and out of focus, each of them compelling and entertaining on their own, and as part of the whole. But as things start to go sideways for Dixie, both business-wise and romantically, I was unsure which loss I was supposed to dread more, mostly because Dixie seems unsure which of the two he is more upset about. Eventually, the music business thread loses steam entirely, and our focus shifts clumsily to the romantic plotline. The focus on satire is lost entirely, if it was ever meant to be satirical in the first place. There are a few odd, overplayed characters, such as Dixie’s boss, and the owners of two rival record companies, but there is no irony in the film’s portrayal of the music business. To me, it just didn’t go very far beyond saying “Here are a bunch of generally ordinary people trying to make it in an industry run by assholes.” </p>

<p>There needs to be irony if there is to be satire, and this film is just too earnest for that. There could have been irony in the way the music business changes Dixie – but it doesn’t change him. He never stops being his sweet, guileless self. Perhaps the film’s irony lies, then, in its title. Dixie claims to want to be a ‘Svengali’, but he is, in fact, the anti-Svengali. There is no dubious intent on his part, no manipulation of the band or anyone else around him. He is surrounded by quite a few bastard Svengali types, but he never goes over to the dark side himself. </p>

<p>In the same way you would pull visual focus to the most interesting element in a shot or scene, pulling the narrative focus to a more interesting internal metamorphosis on Dixie’s part would have been a lot more engaging. As I said before, it’s hard to say anything truly bad about the film, but it just doesn’t maintain its own focus well enough for me to call it a really good film. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>First off, it would be disingenuous to call myself a ‘film critic’ because I don’t have any formal film education, or any real interest in pursuing that particular calling. I suppose the best description of my relationship to criticism is one that suits anyone with a more than passing interest in films and filmmaking—“Film enthusiast” perhaps. All of this is to say that I make no claim to any kind of expertise, apart from whatever aesthetic sense I may have developed over fifty-odd years of watching movies with the same kind of rapt attention other people pay to their favorite pornography.</p>

<p>That said, I have a bone to pick with a couple of the self-appointed literati of online criticism—Scott Tobias, formerly of the defunct <strong>Dissolve</strong> and <a href="http://birthmoviesdeath.com/2015/12/28/i-dont-care-how-hard-it-was-to-make-the-revenant">Devin Faraci</a> of <strong>Birth. Movies. Death.</strong> You two are broadly representative of a prevalent critical bent these days—especially online and <em>especially</em> on twitter. Essentially you are starting to sound like the sort of people who stand backstage mocking the prima ballerina because her ankles are a centimeter too thick, while barely being able to take a breath because of your own morbid obesity. </p>

<p>There are times where your critical engagement seems almost entirely concerned with your perception of the foibles and shortcomings of a particular filmmaker and virtually nothing to do with the film itself. </p>

<p>I am talking specifically, in this case, about Alejandro González Iñárritu.</p>

<p>Aside from the fact that the twitterverse’s opinions of Iñárritu as a human being are about as consequential, or interesting, as watching paint flake, that this kind of psychological conjecture is coming from people with degrees in film studies smacks of the worst kind of unselfconscious irony. </p>

<p>Of course, someone can be an atrocious human being and a perfectly fine film critic (or director for that matter). Each of you clearly seems to understand film and filmmaking, and you often express that understanding in interesting, and often astute, ways. What you do seem <em>particularly</em> unqualified to do is make any kind of assessment about the nature and value of a specific director’s character, or how that might reflect upon his or her work. Unless you know where specific corpses are buried, or whom exactly Iñárritu has chained to a radiator, your speculations about his <a href="https://thedissolve.com/reviews/1152-birdman/">integrity</a>, which seem mostly based on press releases and your own thinly veiled projections of self-loathing, aren’t even minimally pertinent.</p>

<p>Not incidentally, this preoccupation with reading the tea leaves of a creator’s psyche by parsing his press releases within an inch of their life also seems to have very little to do with what is useful in film criticism as a whole. </p>

<p>It was informative to watch the collective knife sharpening that went on within certain critical circles when <em>The Revenant</em> was first announced. The pre-emptive sniggering was deafening. One particularly vituperative Twitterette wondered aloud, oh so cuttingly, “<em>Why would I watch two hours of dudes shitting in the woods</em>?” </p>

<p>Why indeed. So much better to watch someone trying to be clever by reducing literally thousands of hours spent by people of enormous commitment, talent—and in Emmanuel Lubezki’s case—genius, into a caustic tweet. </p>

<p>Now that’s entertainment.</p>

<p>Rebecca Solnit recently wrote a <a href="http://lithub.com/men-explain-lolita-to-me/">couple of interesting pieces</a> about the inherent stupidity of  “must read” lists—specifically about lists of books that are, ostensibly, for men only. One of the more astute observations she made about <em>Lolita</em> was that for some subset of the potential audience it would be almost impossible for them to distance themselves enough to really engage with the novel’s larger themes—that their personal experiences made it too fraught for them to even try. This is almost painfully obvious as a truth. But what it also implies is that any interaction with a cultural artifact—whether book or movie, theatre or music—is inherently constrained as much by the person engaging with it as it is by the original text.</p>

<p>The point here is that maybe Iñárritu isn’t for you. So how about—to save us all from the obvious pain and suffering his work causes you—you and your cadre are hereby released from ever having to engage with Iñárritu and his films again. Then you can avoid the obvious moral and spiritual damage it does to your soul(s) and leave it to the rest of us philistines to struggle with his work: some bad, some good, some, yes, even <em>great</em>. Just like most other artists worth paying attention to.</p>

<p>I certainly understand that no one is holding a gun to my head as far as engaging with <em>your</em> work, but what I’m actually hoping for is that you give your heads a bit of a shake. Because while we have more than enough twitter wags making their reputations for their scathing 140 character bon mots, we don’t have nearly enough interesting and incisive film criticism—something you are both exceptionally good at.</p>

<p>Finally, here is something that Iñárritu had to say about the protagonist of his 2014 film <em>Birdman</em> (for which he <em>somehow</em> won the rare trifecta of Best Picture, Best Director and Best Original Screenplay). </p>

<p>“<em>If you stretch tragedy, it will always become comedy. That&#39;s the comedy that I like. And I always thought about Riggan Thomson as a Don Quixote of La Mancha, where humor comes from the disparity between his solemn, furious attempts and ambitions to become a serious artist and the ungovernable reality that is contrary to his wishes. That&#39;s basically the story of every human being, including me. It&#39;s hard to deal with our mediocrity, I think.</em>”</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Your job on set is to capture hi-res images during filming to be used in promotional materials. For <em>13 Hours: The Secret Soldiers of Benghazi</em>, it seems like every piece of promo circulating is a tribute to John Krasinski’s transformation from mischievous <em>Office</em> heart-throb into a rugged, muscular army man.</p>

<p>I can tell you’re a passionate photographer who provides a solid selection of images for any film or TV show you’re a part_ <a href="http://christianblack.com/">of</a>. Unfortunately for you, most of your images were presumably scrapped in favor of highlighting Krasinski’s new-found identity as a tough-as-nails leading man. Which is a shame, because I’m sure_ _you busted your ass while braving the Libyan heat to capture striking images that would represent the realities of warfare in a city on the brink of revolution.</p>

<p>I waited for the screening of 13 Hours to begin, alongside old, bearded men and college bros — who I suppose are the expected crowd at a Michael Bay biopic about six military operatives fighting off hordes of guerrilla fighters in war-torn Benghazi, Libya. I wondered what the film would do for John Krasinski’s career. Would it do what <em>Taken</em> did for Liam Neeson? Or what <em>John Wick</em> did for Keanu Reeves? The answer is neither. Once the rat-a-tat finally begins, one thing is evident, or not evident as the case may be—John Krasinski is nowhere to be found. </p>

<p>As our brave operatives mow down baddies from their rooftop advantage, I couldn’t help but notice Krasinski’s absence. It is only after the final bullet shell clinks against the concrete, and the smoke clears that he pops his face back into focus, covered in sweat as if he did something. This was a recurring theme throughout the film; any time the heat gets turned up, our hero is invisible. At most, the only time you see Krasinski jump into the fray is when he runs into a burning consulate to try and rescue the U.S. Ambassador.</p>

<p>Was all the media focus on Krasinski purposeful? Only you and the rest of the cast and crew can vouch for that. All I know is I took offence at this misrepresentation, because after viewing <em>13 Hours</em>, Krasinski couldn’t have been more useless.</p>

<p>The spotlight should have been on the true main characters; Rone and Tonto, who carried the film during its most pivotal parts. The exhaustion on their faces was believable—and warranted. 13 Hours isn’t comprised of A-list actors, so any one of the other five men featured could have been the focal point and I wouldn’t have cared. It was the promotional positioning of 13 Hours as the “John Krasinski Show”—and how that was completely untrue—that tarnished the experience for me.</p>

<p>To make matters worse, <em>13 Hours</em> is two hours of military glorification and rampant patriotism. The type of fodder that would be played at a GOP rally. I couldn’t help but think of the infamous scene in Inglorious Basterds where Adolf Hitler and his Nazi sympathizers howl and applaud at the movie screen as Fredrick Zoller levels a wave of Allied troops from his clocktower. It is this brainwashed sense of heroism featured in 13 Hours that make Benghazi seem like a Call of Duty victory, rather than the actual events in which the U.S. government treated these brave men as expendable resources.</p>

<p>I’m not surprised that Michael Bay chose to focus on the ground combat at Benghazi rather than on boardroom politics. It’s his bread and butter. But I was surprised about how the only time we really see Krasinski provide anything of value_ _is in one of your photos.</p>
