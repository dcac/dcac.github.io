    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>You are the yin to Quentin Tarantino’s despicable yang. If you ever met and shook hands I fear that the resulting implosion of egos would envelope the universe. Your film, <em>The Revenant</em>—a period piece set in the American frontier of the early 1800’s—shares enormous similarities, at least in broadly thematic terms, with Tarantino’s <em>The Hateful Eight.</em></p>

<p>These are visually ambitious, violent, sausage-fests filled with men going about the business of bringing death and destruction to themselves and others in settings that underpin how little our ambitions mean. Each depends upon the harshness of the environment to prop up their central conceits. In the <em>Hateful Eight,</em> it is used to facilitate a kind of locked room mystery that leans suspiciously towards the kind of paranoid tension that infuses John Carpenters <em>The Thing</em>. In <em>The Revenant</em> the wintry frontier is where men find their limits and are tested as moral creatures. It is a crucible that sorts the wheat from the chaff. The relentless, unforgiving weather is also an essential backdrop that parallels the kind of men that it attracts—ruthless, volatile and often fundamentally amoral.</p>

<p>Women are only present as uni-dimensional props. This is more to do with the period and location than anything else but it is not a coincidence that each of you specifically chose these settings. Both films, as well, are similarly possessed of a kind of blunt-edged philosophical bent—that more often than risks being overshadowed by the bombast of elevated performances and stunning visual flourishes.</p>

<p>The difference is that the <em>The</em> <em>Revenant</em>’s philosophical underpinnings, while crude, are fully realized, whereas the best than can be said about <em>The Hateful Eight</em> is that the 70mm print <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/1/4/the-hateful-eight.html">sure looks nice</a>. Still, <em>The Revenant</em> is a flawed film, with a central problem it never manages to solve. Even as you successfully express the films straightforward thesis about the hollowness of our collective ambitions and desires, (especially in an environment that often annihilates us with an indifference that is literally chilling) the narrative never manages to really connect this to characters that feel fully realized. As engaging as they are, their motivations remain opaque and often seem fleeting—more contrivance than real.</p>

<p>With performances that are often memorable and idiosyncratic—Domhnall Gleeson and Tom Hardy are rapidly becoming two of the best English language actors around—there is still something untethered about them. The film never manages to connect all its various moving parts, despite DiCaprio’s strong lead and an interesting cast. Part of this is a problem of tone; too often the film meanders narratively when it should be as lean as its characters. However, that can and is often saved by the incredible sweep of the visuals, and the strength of the various interludes of violence and the incredible kineticism of Emmanuel Lubezki’s camera. </p>

<p>The fundamental difficulty, though, is withyour intent. While it is clear what the film expresses, it is not at all clear as to why that expression is worth the work the audience and the characters have to do. A more significant connection needs to be made between why these truths that bang up against one another—individual ambition and desire versus the disinterest of nature—are worthwhile subjects of yet another film. This is, after all, well trodden ground, with any number of films having explored it to greater or lesser degrees of success:<em>Jeremiah</em> <em>Johnson</em>, <em>Little Big Man</em>, _Last Of The Mohicans all have mined this territory extensively.</p>

<p>Still, just as a filmmaking venture bereft of any particular subtext, this is an incredible piece of work. It is head and shoulders above most films I have seen this year, in purely cinematic terms, and will likely win a lot of praise. It is worth seeing as entertainment, even if it falls short as a fully realized work of art.</p>

<p>Despite being a far better filmmaker, at least in terms of scope and originality and perhaps also artistically, you seem to be held to a different critical standard than Tarantino. Whereas you are derided for arrogance or self-regard and lofty, if simplistic, philosophical ambitions, Tarantino seems to be lauded for an ego than perhaps eclipses yours and a philosophical disposition that can be most charitably described as sophomoric. But that is an argument best had elsewhere. </p>

    <id>/content/2016/1/8/hitchcock-truffaut</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>About a third of the way through your documentary <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em>, the point is made that one of cinema’s strengths is its ability to both slow down and speed up time whenever it fits the filmmaker’s needs. And watching your own film, it struck me that speeding things up is also what you’ve done in this examination of François Truffaut’s seminal study of the works of Alfred Hitchcock. <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em>, the film, condenses Truffaut’s book-length interview into a brief (80 minute) overview of the book itself and what it means to its admirers.</p>

<p>Obviously the book’s central conceit – critic-turned-director Truffaut interviewing Alfred Hitchcock in detail about each of his films – clearly spoke to you. And for obvious reasons. As a film critic and essayist, the kind of detailed analysis therein must have been a kind of movie-nerd Nirvana for you, as well as a kind of call to arms. As explained in your film, the book <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em> was the publication that finally put Hitchcock’s films on the critical map as Important Works. Before that, his films were seen as popular, well-executed genre pieces, which left them removed from the realm of serious critical discourse. Truffaut&#39;s book changed that—not only for Hitchcock, but for film in general. Great art could be found anywhere, even coming out of Hollywood’s factory-like studios.</p>

<p>When it comes to critical examination, you, like Truffaut, subscribe to the <em>auteur</em> theory, which sees the director as the guiding force behind every aspect of a film. And to back that theory up, you’ve assembled a wide-ranging collection of directors to speak on how the book <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em> influenced their understandings of cinema as an art form. Watching Martin Scorsese, David Fincher, Wes Anderson, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Richard Linklater, and a host of others wax nostalgic on their first experiences with Truffaut’s book offers terrific insight into their development as artists. In hindsight, it seems obvious that this is where Fincher learned his laser-focused scene construction, or where Anderson’s love of image composition was born. In a way, their relationship to the book provides some of the same insight that Truffaut’s book does. The simple act of expressing their love for it is a form of (self-)critical analysis.  </p>

<p>But it may be that your deference towards directors, not just Truffaut and Hitchcock, gets the better of you in the end. Although <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em>’s first half crosscuts between both directors equally, placing them in their own historical and cultural landscapes, the film gradually pushes Truffaut into the background. Instead, <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em> starts to seem more like <em>Hitchcock/Scorsese/Fincher/Anderson/Linklater/Kurosawa</em> etc. Hitchcock’s style and technique becomes the focal point, with barely a mention of Truffaut. </p>

<p>I realize this may have been on purpose. Perhaps the strategy was to shift the focus from interviewer to his subject, as Truffaut does in his own book. But as narrator Bob Balaban describes the later careers of both artists, wrapping the film up, I realized that the <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em> had become less about the book itself – it’s place in history, its influence on others – and more about Hitchcock’s importance as a filmmaker. </p>

<p>Simply put, it ends up trying to do a job Truffaut’s book already completed almost 50 years ago.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>There’s something about the sea that invites meditation and personal reflection. The undulating ripples, soothing repetition, brilliant blues. But that same sea can be terrifying. Crushing waves, a deafening roar, inky depths that have welcomed countless men down to sleep in Davy Jones Locker. This dichotomy is why seafaring adventures have captured our imagination for centuries. From <em>Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em> to <em>The Perfect Storm,</em> audiences know: when something goes wrong at sea, it often goes horribly wrong. </p>

<p>The same can be said of big-budget films. </p>

<p>No matter how many times you’re tasked with painting an ocean backdrop, I imagine each one is different. It takes a skilled hand to navigate such waters. Too light and it might come across as childish and shallow, too heavy and the result is murky, ugly, swamp-like. <em>In the Heart of the Sea</em> sails into both territories but never manages to find an even keel. Ron Howard has made a rollicking, effects-heavy sea adventure. He has also made a morality tale about class warfare and the hubris of resource depletion. And he has <em>also</em> made a relentlessly dark and mournful film about survival against the odds and the triumph of the human spirit. </p>

<p>Unfortunately they’re all the same film. </p>

<p><em>In the Heart of the Sea</em> is an adaptation of the book that claims to be the true story upon which the American opus _Moby Dick is based. In 1820, a Nantucket whaling ship, The Essex, was destroyed by a sperm whale in the Pacific. Many of the crew lost their lives, and for the few who survived, the true story of what transpired on the ship remained a closely guarded secret. In 1850, Tom Nickerson, the last living survivor of the shipwreck, is visited by the writer Herman Melville, who pays him to tell him the story of what really happened on The Essex when he was just a boy of fourteen. The film flashes back to 1820 when experienced whaler Owen Chase, expecting to be made the captain of The Essex, is usurped by George Pollard, the son of a wealthy ship-builder. The conflict between the beloved and skilled Chase, and the cold and inexperienced Pollard threatens the entire expedition.</p>

<p>Any painter understands the importance of light and how to use it—in reflection, in shadow, in perspective. Howard, too, uses every opportunity to illustrate just how crucial whale oil was to lighting 18th Century America, and in doing so sets the visual tone for the film. In Nantucket, everything looks like an Old Master’s oil painting. From the slick cobblestoned streets, to the sunlight that streams through leaded glass windows. But there is grotesquerie here, too. In one particularly disgusting scene on The Essex, young Tom is dropped into a dead whale’s blowhole to retrieve the last of the oil, his lantern exposing the dripping, fatty innards of the beast’s head. Whaling is ugly business, but without it, Pollard reminds us, “The world would be plunged into darkness.”</p>

<p>It’s on the ocean where your work – and the film – visually come alive. Your paintings and the digital 3D elements complement each other beautifully, and we are treated to an abundant world above and below the water. Scenes of men harpooning a whale and being dragged along behind it, and of a particularly nasty storm, really showcase the harmony between your work and the CGI elements. And when we finally see the Great White Whale, the spectacle is quite literally breathtaking. It’s a shame, though, that the tone of the film gets lost at sea.</p>

<p><em>In the Heart of the Sea</em>’s overlapping themes and one-dimensional characters feel conspicuously flimsy, especially against the film’s vivid realism and attention to graphic detail. The relentless formality of the dialogue, with its, “ahoys”, and “hoist the sails, Master Joy!” may be period appropriate but it feels like it was cribbed from an Errol Flynn swashbuckler. As the story plunges into grimmer territory, it is difficult to conjure up the pathos necessary to follow these characters on their somber journey since we’ve only ever been given sketches of who they are and what they stand for.</p>

<p>The golden rule of screenwriting is “show, don’t tell”, and, in this case, what we are shown far eclipses what we are told. It’s a pity. On the page, this story is thrilling and intense. On the screen, <em>In the Heart of the Sea</em> is hopelessly adrift.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Normally I don’t have much interest in whether a movie is shot on film or digital—in the sense that neither format is intrinsically superior to the other. Watching what Roger Deakins does with <em>Sicario</em> (a movie shot digitally) or the kind of storytelling vérité facilitated by the amped up iPhones of <em>Tangerine,</em> it is glaringly obvious that it is a po-tay-toe, po-tah-toe situation. But in the case of <em>The Hateful Eight</em> it would be much less interesting as a film without the distinctive flavor you bring to the table.</p>

<p>What Tarantino does with the space within the frame and depth of detail, the richer colors your presence signals, the way he frames the action and plays with long takes—two or three characters will move through the background of a long static shot, telling their own story in counterpoint to the character in the foreground, or the camera will change focal points several times in the same take—really makes this a film that is utterly married to its format. </p>

<p>Which is a good thing, all that business, because otherwise this is like every other film Tarantino has made since the first <em>Kill Bill</em>—an utterly empty exercise in formalism. Each film since then, including the <em>The Hateful Eight,</em> has been an adolescent revenge fantasy usually linked to a dilettante’s understanding of history, and is inevitably stuffed to the brim with thematic and visual callbacks to the kinds of films Tarantino fetishizes.</p>

<p>These films lack two essential things: the characters are so cartoonishly drawn that I honestly couldn’t care less what happens to them, (in contrast to when Vincent Vega gets gunned down on the toilet in <em>Pulp Fiction</em>—that was some real pathos), and there is no <em>there</em> there. The endless masturbatory references to the kinds of films Quentin likes is nothing but a pointless distraction, a kind of empty cultural signaling that becomes what the film is about. One of those kinds of films is probably enough for any filmmaker but it seems like this is the whole of Tarantino’s arsenal these days. </p>

<p>The dark promise of <em>Reservoir Dogs,</em> the manic genius of <em>Pulp Fiction,</em> the assured storytelling maturity of <em>Jackie Brown</em> all seem lost beneath an increasing tendency Tarantino has to parody his own tropes. Extended dialogue scenes that used to crackle are now so overtly constructed they trip over their own intentional cleverness. Violence that was once brutal and gritty in its heightened reality (Uma taking a needle to her chest—just the <em>sound</em> that made) has been replaced with Looney Tunes-esque, Daffy-getting-his-bill-turned-upside-down nonsense. Kurt Russell makes one character’s head literally disappear, like some two-bit frontier magician.</p>

<p>In these reviews, we offer a short plot summary to let everyone know what they are going to see. Usually all that’s required is a light sketch, but it could be a wall-sized mural and it wouldn’t make a bit of difference to anyone’s understanding of this story, because Tarantino isn’t really a storyteller anymore. He has become his own kind of cultural event, a continuous and never-ending performance piece aided and abetted by the kind of stunt casting you represent. Because as masterfully as you are utilized here, your beauty and depth is in aid of a whole lot of sound and fury, signifying absolutely nothing.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>“Say from whence  </p>

<p>You owe this strange intelligence…”</p>

<p>~Macbeth, Act I, Scene III</p>

<p>Your adaptation of <em>Macbeth</em> is a bold venture in a variety of ways. It is ruthless in what it omits from the source material, much of the dialogue is delivered in a naturalistic rather than a theatrical way—and the battle scenes are so audacious they would have overwhelmed a lesser work. But the most successful—and ballsiest—risk you took with the narrative was to privilege the visuals over the language. Even in the face of Shakespeare’s transcendent genius.</p>

<p>Your <em>Macbeth</em> successfully does what so few other film adaptations of Shakespeare dare to do: let the story spool out as a visual experience, rather than falling into the trap of simply filming an amped up stage production. This success is, in large part, attributable to how effectively you manage the transitions from quiet melancholy to ethereal battlefields, and then into the moments of vicious, ugly betrayal that are the twisted heart of this story. So much of that work is done by the choices you and your director Justin Kurzel make, and the way those choices subtly underline the larger themes that run throughout <em>Macbeth</em>.</p>

<p>It certainly doesn’t hurt your case that you had two of the more formidable actors of our time—Michael Fassbender and Marion Cotillard—to play Lord and Lady Macbeth. Each has a distinctive and riveting physical presence that transmits much of the work’s subtext without requiring them to utter a word. The endless tension between guilt, madness, ambition and duty is present whenever they’re onscreen. They embody these themes in the tilt of a head, an unbroken stare, the endless, restless motion of Fassbender’s doomed Thane. When Fassbender utters, “full of scorpions is my mind” you can _see the madness seething—in a way you never could in a live performance. </p>

<p>Despite all of this, it is undeniably Shakespeare’s <em>Macbeth</em> that fills the screen. This film feels so true to the intention of the work, even as it takes liberty with its form, that more than once I was moved to tears by the sheer passion of it all. </p>

<p>Since <em>Macbeth</em> is constructed of equal parts visual bombast and subtle performance, it is a film that absolutely requires the cooperation of the audience. It expects a particular kind of attention—<em>because</em> so much of the work is done by the visuals. When Macbeth assassinates his King, plunging the dagger again and again and again, until the man’s chest is nothing but a tatters of blood and cloth, Macbeth is not just committing regicide, he is also killing the better angels of his own nature. While this is a narrative pivot where madness and doom become the only path Macbeth can follow, it is also a visual shorthand for his complicated psychological journey from loyal Thane to ruthless Kingslayer. </p>

<p>The marriage between what Shakespeare wrote and what you managed to build onscreen is profound. It is rare that I‘ve had an experience with a piece of art that felt so fulfilling and complete. <em>Macbeth</em> is something I will watch and rewatch in the same way I do with films like <em>Winter’s Bone</em> or <em>Throne of Blood</em> or even <em>Children of Men</em>—each being works that are completely true to themselves and utterly robust in their confidence of that truth.</p>

    <id>/content/2016/1/4/love</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>The week between Christmas and the New Year is always a fuzzy period of limbo-ish down time where there doesn’t seem to be much point in doing any actual work or adhering to any routine. So an email asking, “Feel like reviewing a porn film over the holidays?” provided the perfect opportunity to be somewhat productive without having to interrupt these few precious days of doing nothing much at all. </p>

<p>I saw the poster for Gaspar Noé’s <em>Love</em> a while ago, which depicted a three-way kiss with lots of tongue and visible threads of saliva hanging between the mouths of the kissers. So I figured I was in for a couple of hours of artfully composed, meandering insights on the connection between love and physical intimacy, punctuated by interludes of explicit sex. My companion remarked, “Yeah, but it’s 3D sex!” Sure it’s interesting as a concept, but my concluding belief is that some things should never, ever be seen in 3D. Let’s just leave it at that. </p>

<p>Noé’s previous explorations of sex, violence, and various combinations of the two, aren’t my cup of tea, but I appreciate the way in which he constructs memory (or dissects it) by playing with chronology. <em>Love</em> is far tamer, and less violent and disturbing than <em>Irreversible</em> or <em>I Stand Alone</em>. The film digs through a couple’s past, gathering snapshot images of their time together to construct a layered, multi-angled picture of their relationship. Some of the images are quite pretty, but the whole picture is decidedly less than flattering.</p>

<p>Murphy wakes up on New Year’s Day to a frantic voicemail from the mother of his missing ex-girlfriend, Electra. When his current partner, Omi, and their toddler leave for the day, he takes the opportunity to get high and wallow in selfpity as he looks back on his relationship with Electra. From Murphy’s point of view, theirs was a great love, ruined when Murphy is ‘trapped’ by a cunning Omi and a broken condom. Flashbacks add different angles to this narrative, roughening its edges and cracking its surface until a clearer picture emerges – one where a teenaged Omi is invited into the couple’s bed for a threesome, and the broken condom incident occurs when Murphy and Omi indulge in a subsequent three-minus-one-some without Electra. Delving further into Murphy and Electra’s story reveals a brutal break up, preceded by a string of betrayals and dysfunction on both sides. </p>

<p>Now, back to all of the sex - because let’s face it, no one is buying a ticket to this film for its evocative portrayal of love lost. The sex scenes are beautifully shot, but ultimately boring and often unerotic. They serve to present a stripped-down picture of Murphy and Electra’s relationship, varying levels of passion versus mere utility reflecting the wavering connection between the two. Ideally, the sex scenes would be, at most, a visual complement to a narrative grounded in the chemistry between the romantic leads. But that chemistry just isn’t there. If anything, the sex scenes rescued me from disengaging completely, holding my interest with a 3D shot of – actually, never mind, I never want to see that again and I’d like to forget I ever saw it in the first place. </p>

<p>My lack of fondness or compassion for Murphy and Electra, or at least one of the two, was problematic given that this is essentially supposed to be a love story. I should empathize with Murphy’s pain and regret, but he is such an insufferable, jealous, petulant, entitled, controlling, self-absorbed, man-child that this was impossible. We do see glimmers of something deeper in him at times– when he is with his child, and when he realizes the severity of Electra’s drug addiction, – but his overall propensity for dickish behavior (like dragging a reluctant Electra to a sex club, then throwing a tantrum when she does exactly what people at a sex club tend to do) dulls any impact these small moments may have had. </p>

<p>As your team’s job was to create vivid, three-dimensional images by layering separate, flatter images, I thought you might best appreciate the parallel I see in the narrative’s attempt to take various snapshots of the characters that are unflattering on the surface and merge them to present a more multifaceted picture, revealing certain complexities (or at least creating the illusion of them), alter our perception accordingly. You succeed on your part, but the narrative does not. The composite image of Murphy should have altered significantly as all his layers were merged (or peeled back, depending on your point of view), but due to his stunning lack of self-awareness, he is just as much of an asshole weeping in a bathtub at the end of the film as he is inwardly snarling at the mother of his child at the beginning. Electra and Omi are permitted no development at all, remaining wooden, one-dimensional archetypes throughout the film. </p>

<p>Normally, if a film promised me nothing but wall-to-wall boning, I’d be all over it. But <em>Love</em> professes to offer something more, and the explicit sex is secondary to the tragic, impassioned unraveling of a man longing for the one that got away. The thing is, if you take away all the boning, you just have two co-dependent nutcases yelling at each other, which just isn’t very ‘<em>ah,</em> <em>l’amour</em>.’</p>

    <id>/content/2016/1/4/joy</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>There is something about every film he makes that screams <strong>David O. Russell</strong>. He is a director that—for better or worse—leaves his mark on every moment, every scene. Whether <em>The Fighter</em>, <em>American Hustle</em>, <em>Silver Linings Playbook,</em> <em>I (heart) Huckabees</em> or even <em>Three Kings</em> there is no doubt that these are the creations of a singular mind. To be heard above that din means you have done something that is either noteworthy or really, really bad.</p>

<p>In your case it certainly <em>isn’t</em> the latter of that binary.</p>

<p>My first contact with your work was the film <em>Winter’s Bone,</em> which is perhaps one of my personal favorites, for reasons that are far too complex to articulate here. However, a lot of my love for that film was the result of how thoroughly you inhabited the character of Ree, a young women who is required by circumstances to bear burdens no teenager should have to carry. Ree’s quiet strength, her integrity, her ability to overcome her fear were something you managed to convey in a remarkably nuanced way, especially for someone so young.</p>

<p>All of that nuance, and more, was required in your portrayal of Joy in Russell’s film of the same name. He is a director that is drawn to outsized characters—incandescent personalities who push back against the bounds of whatever conventions they see as constraints. In this case Joy is a young mid-Western women, waking from a seventeen-year stasis (allegorically not literally) to find her life is not at all what she had hoped for. The film begins with Russell essentially listing her burdens: a poorly paying job, two young children, an ex-husband living in her basement alongside an eccentric, and really irritating, father—and a mother so paralyzed by fear of the world that she will not leave her room. The least of her burdens is her maternal grandmother, who Russell fitfully engages as a kind of narrative contrivance, but who is the only person, initially at least, who is fully in Joy’s corner.</p>

<p>The rest of the film is a depiction of Joy’s awakening to her own power—her stop-and-start journey towards an existence that goes beyond facilitating the needs of others. While told in Russell’s often unsubtle mode, you still manage to create a rounded character—a woman who begins to create some clarity of purpose in her own existence even as most of those around her try to shove her back into the role they find most comfortable and utilitarian. In short, the history of all family dynamics throughout time. </p>

<p>Your ability to shape a real character—often through a kind of transcendent integrity and an ability to convey a whole range of emotions with a single small gesture—is what prevents Joy from becoming just another paper doll in Russell’s playground. The same cannot be said of most of the rest of the cast. Even Robert De Niro and Bradley Cooper are really nothing more than awkwardly placed obstacles to Joy and her ambitions. </p>

<p>This film was profoundly affecting for me because so much of the social landscape Joy had to maneuver through reminded me of watching what my mother had to endure after she and my father divorced. As a young, single mother of three in the early Seventies, my mother managed to penetrate the burgeoning tech industry as a programmer and fought through all the considerable institutional and social obstacles to forge a life for herself and her children. That kind of struggle was front and center throughout this film, and, at least for me, excused any number of the usual sins of excess that inevitably plague a David O. Russel film.</p>

<p>This is a powerful story that you serve enormously well, and it is a pity that your performance is undercut by Russell’s inability to get out of his own way. But you still managed to create, in <em>Joy</em>, a real flesh and blood woman whose struggles should resonate with almost anyone with eyes and any kind of heart.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>We gave up on trying to create a single year-end Top 10 on Dear Cast and Crew long ago. And good riddance.  Critics secretly love these year-end assessments, as reductive as they might be. Ranking and categorizing films help us to not only define the year in cinema, but, in some ways, define ourselves over the past year. So feel free to puzzle together my personal psychology through my list(s), or just keep this page handy when you’re looking for what to see in the coming months – and what to avoid.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>The 1950s was an era of unprecedented prosperity and hope. Increased wealth, conspicuous consumption, and booming industry were the hallmarks of post-WWII America. Cars, in particular, had become the physical embodiment of the American dream; powerful machines built by proud, hard-working men and women, who were basking in the triumphant glow of global victory. Cars transported the luckiest people in the world on boundless journeys, the open road a symbol of the bright and exciting future that lay ahead. </p>

<p>But in the 1950s, the luckiest people in the world were predominantly white, heterosexual, American men. For most everyone else, the dream was still out of reach. </p>

<p><em>Carol</em> tells a story of forbidden love that is very much a reflection of its times, but like the most heart-wrenching and universal love stories, it is timeless. The titular Carol is an upper class wife and mother who falls in love with a shop-girl named Therese. Though Carol and her husband Harge are estranged and planning to divorce, her indiscretion drives Harge to force an ultimatum: break off the affair and cancel the divorce or lose custody of their young daughter, Rindy.</p>

<p>Director Todd Haynes has covered themes of longing and loss before, most notably in 2002’s <em>Far From Heaven</em> and the 2011 mini-series <em>Mildred Pierce</em>, which both featured female protagonists struggling to overcome the restrictive cultural expectations that were the norm in the not-so-distant past. Indeed, in 1948 when author Patricia Highsmith wrote the novel, <em>The Price of Salt</em>, upon which <em>Carol</em> is based, her publishers refused it and she had to resubmit it using a pseudonym. And though <em>Carol</em> explores themes of class, parental rights, and homosexuality, it is first and foremost a love story. </p>

<p>Therese is working at a department store when she first sees Carol shopping for Christmas toys for her daughter. In a display case, hundreds of dolls are behind glass, but the doll Carol wants is sold out. Therese recommends a train set instead. Both women could be display case dolls themselves; Cate Blanchett’s Carol, is a cool and elegant Barbie to Rooney Mara’s younger, wide-eyed kewpie doll. They are cautious and mannered - neither wanting to be the first to break the character she has carefully constructed for herself. </p>

<p>In a time when keeping up appearances was paramount, Haynes created a sumptuous visual landscape for his characters to inhabit.</p>

<p>The costumes, hair, make-up, set decoration, and props are period perfect, yes, but the art direction in general is mesmerizing. The characters seem to constantly interact with reflective surfaces, like store and apartment windows, mirrors, and in particular, the windows of cars. It’s a dream-like effect that mimics both the state of being in love, and the pain of love lost. The glass provides a window into their lives as well as a barrier. They can only come so close to being themselves without letting the rest of the world see them for who they really are. </p>

<p>The cars you provided, like Carol’s Deluxe Packard, her best friend Abby’s convertible, Harge’s black Cadillac (with a driver), and the yellow cabs Therese takes, illustrate their literal and figurative mobility. When Harge takes Rindy away from Carol prior to their first custody hearing, Carol decides to get in her car and drive, “wherever the car will take me”. Therese joins her on this journey west, and she and Carol grow closer to one another the way people do when confined together on a road trip. With every pit stop at a roadside diner or a motel, they begin to drop pretenses and revel in the freedom that comes from this break in their regular lives; the freedom of being able to get behind the wheel and drive away from your problems. Except, in the case of Carol and Therese, their problems follow them.  </p>

<p>It’s a joy to see female characters written with such depth and played so achingly well by actors at the top of their game. We’ve been spoiled by Cate Blanchett, having come to expect her to deliver award-worthy performances, and she deserves every accolade for playing Carol with such restrained determination. But it’s Rooney Mara’s Therese who seems to grow before our very eyes, and her portrayal of a young woman coming into adulthood is both gut-wrenching and inspiring. </p>

<p>Carol’s Packard is where Therese comes of age, and experiences a full range of emotions, from elation to despair. Anyone who has been in love and felt the all-consuming anguish of a broken heart, will understand that it’s a rare gift to travel the road of self-discovery and make it to the other side intact. <em>Carol</em> itself is a rare cinematic gift, and it was a privilege to follow these characters on their journey.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>“Hae-Won? Hae-Won? Hae-Won? <em>Hae</em>-Won? Hae-<em>Won</em>? <em>Hae-Won</em>?  Hey-one?” </p>

<p>That’s my rendition of the <em>hi-larious scene in _Sisters</em> when Amy Poehler’s character, Maura, has trouble pronouncing her Korean manicurist’s name. Annoying isn’t it, Lee? Now imagine two hours of that and you’ve got the gist of <em>Sisters</em>.</p>

<p>It was so funny that I practically had to restrain myself from walking out of the theatre. Yes, I’m being sarcastic. No, I’m not kidding about almost walking out. <em>Sisters</em> is some grade-A b.s., and your lack of editing shoulders much of the blame.</p>

<p>This type of <em>funny-then-not-funny-then-funny-again</em> joke has to be handled carefully. If used sparingly, and at the right time, you’ve got a quality piece of comedy on your hands. Take the infamous rake scene in <em>The Simpsons Cape Fear</em> parody for example. The amount of times Sideshow Bob accidentally gets bashed in the face with a rake (eight, I counted) gets tiresome after the fourth or fifth go, but soon after, the reality of the scene settles in. Sideshow Bob has been dragged through a cactus patch and had hot coffee spilled on him; the last thing he needs is a recurring rake to the face. Your empathy towards the character turns to laughter and comedic history is made. </p>

<p><em>Sisters</em> takes this concept and cranks it to 11.</p>

<p>Amy Poehler and Tina Fey are hilarious—together and separately. Their work on <em>SNL</em> and their respective TV shows, <em>Parks and Recreation, 30 Rock,</em> and <em>The Unbreakable Kimmy Schmidt</em>, are some of the best comedies to come out in recent years. I have huge respect for both of them, but the lowbrow humour in <em>Sisters</em> is just insulting. The premise of two sisters who reunite to throw one last party in their childhood home before it’s sold isn’t exactly a knee-slapper, but I like to be optimistic. Still, I wasn’t expecting <em>that</em> many anal-related gags.</p>

<p><em>Sisters</em> stretches every joke to an unbearable point. Any time there’s a bit that could be milked for an extra few seconds, everyone runs with it. I suspect a lot of these jokes were the product of improv. When the cast is as tight-knit as the one in <em>Sisters</em>, silliness is a healthy side effect. They have a personal connection to the content. But it’s your job to dial back the foolishness when it goes too far. You should have slashed any joke that repeated itself more than twice.   </p>

<p>If viewers make it to the end of the film, they’re treated to a blooper reel where Maura repeats Hae-Won another fifty times! Which begs the question, why did you stop where you did? Couldn’t you have shaved another minute or two off the Hae-Won scene? Or any other scene for that matter? Couldn’t you have used your years of experience in editing comedies to fix the broken try-too-hard that is <em>Sisters</em>?</p>

<p>To <em>Sisters</em> credit, there were at least one or two nuggets of gold. When Maura says that she’s taken up cheese-making as a hobby, I chuckled at the line’s subtle delivery. Miraculously, she didn’t try to go ahead and name every cheese she’s made. There wasn’t anything more to that line and it was just fine without the embellishment. Tina Fey and Amy Poehler are funny ladies; they’re sharp and witty. They don’t need to be so obtrusive in their approach, and you shouldn’t sit idly by and let a hot mess like this happen again.</p>
