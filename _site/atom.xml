    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p><em>Jackie</em>, much more than some other films, relies upon its visual design to underpin its narrative intentions. Your previous work with directors like Bertolucci (<em>Dreamers</em>) and Caro &amp; Jeunet (<em>Delicatessen, City of Lost Children</em>) attests to your talent for collaborating with directors who put design at the forefront of their films. In <em>Jackie</em>, this is a fundamental requirement. So much of what physically appears within the frame is essential to appreciating the core of this complex and fascinating story.</p>

<p>It may seem counterintuitive to suggest that what you see on the screen is anything but important, but the truth is, for many films, production design is nothing but a collection of props: we’re in New York so there have to be exteriors showing specific landmarks, or the film is set in the seventies so someone has to be wearing a pair of oversized bell bottoms. But none of these elements necessarily speak to a film’s central themes. Instead they’re window dressing; they’re used to create a patina of authenticity. <em>Jackie</em> is much more deliberate and calculated than that—every prop, every dress, every location contributes to the intent of the film.</p>

<p><em>Jackie</em> is a lesson in how a communications strategy can shape public perception. Centred around JFK’s assassination and his funeral, it’s a formalist exercise that focuses on Jacqueline Kennedy and her struggle to shape her husband’s legacy. An example of this layered calculation is how a scene early in the film is composed: Billy Crudup, the reporter who is tasked with interviewing Jackie (who is portrayed with a stiff and anguished brilliance by Natalie Portman) comes to the door and Jackie answers; each part of their conversation is a single shot in which the characters speak directly to the camera. This kind of throwback to a sixties television convention is initially jarring, but serves as proof that this film is meticulously shaped to create a very specific atmosphere.</p>

<p>From the very first frame, director Pablo Larraín makes clear that this will be a mannered portrayal of one of contemporary history’s most pivotal moments. Each second is deliberately composed; the costume design, locations, set design – even the hair and makeup – feel utterly authentic to the time and also underpin an aesthetic that is precisely in tune with the film makers broader purpose: we are meant to understand what it is to see history being intentionally shaped, rather than simply recorded.</p>

<p>There are intimations throughout of Jackie’s profound appreciation for how history is written in the television age. As she and Bobby Kennedy ride with JFK’s body to the hospital (and his imminent autopsy), Jackie quizzes the driver as to whether he knows who McKinley and Garfield are. When he pleads ignorance, she asks if he remembers Lincoln. Of course he does. The point she makes is that all three are assassinated presidents, but only one lingers in the nation’s collective, historical memory. </p>

<p>Jackie’s single purpose from that moment onward is to make sure her husband is remembered. She does this through a semi-catatonic state fuelled by cigarettes, alcohol, and pills. She manoeuvres around various government officials, including Lyndon Johnson and even her own brother-in-law, to orchestrate the kind of spectacle that television loves, and, in doing so, she cement her husband’s place in history. </p>

<p>These moments are what’s recorded, and therefore become history. She understood the power of new media (in this case television) and how it could be shaped and exploited. The film itself mirrors this aesthetic, creating an exacting portrait of Jackie that is laser-focused in its intentions. In essence, we will only ever see the Jacqueline Kennedy that Larraín wants us to see: a woman who is thought of as an ingenue, a cardboard cut-out, but who understands far better than anyone else what will preserve her husband’s place in history.</p>

<p>Even her interview with Crudup is punctuated by her insistence that she shape and edit his prose. She shares all sorts of unsavoury details, afterwards reminding Crudup that none of this will see print. Portman gives a singular performance, her grief and near hysteria masking a calculating and savage intellect. It is really something to behold. </p>

<p>I don’t often connect with this sort of cold, intentionally constructed film. But by the end of <em>Jackie</em> I was profoundly engaged, largely because your approach to production design was more than just an exercise in technique. The most affecting example of this is Jackie choosing JFK’s gravesite in Arlington cemetery: she rejects the initial site and slogs through the mud and rain and gravestones (eventually ditching her shoes) until she finds a place so perfect it seems a painting. The final shot in the scene, in which she’s standing in front of the site—is so beautiful it almost brought me to tears.</p>

<p><em>Jackie</em> manages something that few films do—it integrates design, narrative, and performance into a coherent whole that represents a very specific point of view. </p>

    <title>American Honey</title>

    <id>www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/12/7/american-honey</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>There aren’t many three-hour long indie dramas that leave me feeling energized at the end. <em>American Honey</em> is an exception to the rule; I left the theatre unusually upbeat. A big part of that has to do with the story and the way it’s told, but the real shot of adrenaline came from seeing the credits. </p>

<p>We first get that indulgent claim that this is “a film by,” which in any other production would cite the writer/director (in this case, the incredibly talented Andrea Arnold). Instead, the actors’ names come next, one by one, and then a crowded list of 50+ names, arranged alphabetically, without attribution. Your name is on that list (and so it Arnold’s). And then we get another screen filled with names, and another one. After that, the credits do their legal duty of citing all the rights holders for the pop music in the film (the <em>only</em> music in the film), a few thank-yous, and we’re out. </p>

<p>What a refreshing reminder of the collaborative nature of filmmaking.</p>

<p><em>American Honey</em> exudes that spirit throughout. It’s a free-spirited open road movie that does little to satisfy those fixated on plot (a sin that I’m often guilty of). Yet this is hardly a formless Terrence Malick-style movie—the film has a clear star (this is literally Sasha Lane’s character name) and a linear story for her to follow, which makes the rest of her wandering particularly compelling. Star, as a dumpster-diving, short-shorts-wearing, dreadlocked teenager who joins a travelling magazine sales crew, is pretty much the modern dictionary definition of A Hot Mess. But by the time she’s drawn into the life on the road to escape her disgusting and dire home life, every shot of passing landscape and new urban development feels like a vision of hope and opportunity. </p>

<p>The biggest draw for her, of course, isn’t the prospect of selling magazines on the road, but following Shia LeBoeuf’s charming charlatan—and he plays his cards to perfection. For much of the movie, we don’t really understand what the kids do or how the whole thing really works, but we do have faith that something is holding it all together. Just like the film itself. With dangers popping up, jealousies ready to boil over, and a wide range of non-professional actors that all feel incredibly suited to their roles, the whole production feels like a less cynical Harmony Korine movie. In fact, it seems impossible that the director isn’t straight out of this demographic herself (she’s a 55 year-old British Oscar-winner, which might surprise even you). But that’s a credit to Arnold’s trust in her collaborators, and her ability to find a way to tell the story of impoverished youth and rebellion that doesn’t fetishize or patronize the experience. </p>

<p>So whatever you did—be proud. It all added up in the end.</p>

    <id>www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/12/2/allied</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>There’s a scene early in your new spy thriller <em>Allied</em> that is representative of everything I love about the kind of big-budget studio filmmaking that you’ve practiced for the last three decades. It’s a simple moment: Brad Pitt, as a stoic Canadian spy hiding in plain sight behind enemy lines, pulls up to a curb outside a nightclub in Nazi-occupied Morocco, parks his car, puts a suitcase in the trunk, and strolls inside.</p>

<p>There’s something magical about the composition of this sequence; the way the camera moves, the way the extras pass through the foreground and background, the sets, the costumes, the impossibly perfect arrangement of bodies and objects within the frame, the impossibly perfect way those bodies and objects are lit—it’s all terribly contrived, and patently unreal, yet somehow transporting and beautiful and utterly believable. It’s the sort of heightened reality that big-screen cinema does better than any other form of media. It’s better than real.</p>

<p>But let’s compare that relatively brief (and narratively innocuous) scene with the opening shot of the film: </p>

<p>A desert landscape lit in pinks and oranges. One of those big, panoramic establishing shots that inevitably conjures thoughts of David Lean. But you let it linger for only a moment. The vista is suddenly obscured by a pair of boots as Brad Pitt descends into frame, strapped into a parachute. The camera follows him as he drifts down towards the sandy dunes, lands, rolls, stands up, and scuffles off on his secret mission. </p>

<p>There is a different kind of contrivance in this moment. And it’s one that has plagued you throughout your career, from way back in the <em>Death Becomes Her</em> days, through to your recent infatuation with motion-capture animation. It’s hard to articulate, but is perhaps best explained as an issue of prioritization: it seems that your technical expression of the story is more important than the story itself. Special effects take precedence over character. Self-conscious camera maneuvers take precedence over narrative clarity. </p>

<p>This is a complaint often leveled at stylists, and it’s not without merit. Brian DePalma is often accused of favoring the mechanics of scene-construction over moral clarity, and Nicolas Winding Refn is often described as an auteur of mood in search of a plot (I happen to disagree on both counts). Ironically, though, you’re not a stylist; certainly not in the same vein as your contemporaries in the 80s Blockbuster Brat-Pack (eg. Steven Spielberg, Tim Burton—two fellas who also struggle, in very different ways, with the infinite potential of modern special effects). </p>

<p>You’re a technologist. The method of storytelling fascinates you. In your best films – the first <em>Back To The Future</em> and <em>Cast Away</em> – this bit of authorial distance works. There’s a naturalism (yes, even in BTTF) that is never quite swallowed by your perpetual desire to show off what special effects make possible. But just because anything is possible doesn’t mean that anything goes. </p>

<p>The fakery, in <em>Allied</em>, is disarming. </p>

<p>And I’m not even talking about the part where a woman gives birth in the streets of London during a Nazi air raid (that’s as noisy and cluttered with action as the climax of a Transformer movie). When the baby is finally born, the soundtrack goes magically silent, the bombs stop dropping, the guns stop blazing, which I totally accept, because such elegant hypocrisies are what make The Movies special.   </p>

<p>No, I’m talking scenes like the one that takes place in a parked car in the middle of a desert sandstorm—you know, the sex scene you cribbed from <em>The English Patient</em>. As Pitt and co-star Marion Cotillard get hot and heavy, the camera spins around them, and even though we know cognitively that no camera could really fit inside that car, our disbelief is suspended because the sound design is terrific, and there’s something interesting about the way the scene is edited, a cut after each rotation to a shot on the opposite axis. It sounds complex, showy, but somehow feels in service to the story, a representation of the furious, cyclonic passion in which our two protagonists find themselves caught. </p>

<p>But then the camera (can we even call it a “camera” anymore, the way the frame moves self-consciously through space like some weightless/purposeless/brainless entity) stops, pulls backwards, exits the car through the rear window, and drifts off into the CGI sandstorm, ostensibly to offer the lovers a bit of privacy, but, really, to show off what it can do. </p>

<p>These boasts and brags quickly become tiresome. </p>

<p>Beneath the veneer of epic wartime romance, <em>Allied</em> is really a film about marriage, and how, over time, and despite the best intentions of those involved, the terms of a marriage contract can dramatically change. Which is something, I think, that anyone who is (or has been) married can identify with. I should have been thinking deeply about these ideas when I left the theatre. I should have felt a little bit betrayed, too, by the final ten minutes of the film. So much suspense is generated by the meticulous yielding of information about the film’s central mystery, but is played out in such a conventional manner. Many scenes and lines of dialogue hint at an underlying complexity, which, in an instant of confession are rendered utterly meaningless. </p>

<p>And it’s a shame, because I could have liked this movie. There’s a certain confidence with which a veteran director like you can stage a scene. And there is much in <em>Allied</em> that proves your confidence is earned—I’m sick, quite frankly, of all this Jason Bourne-verité. I yearn for the return of a sort of grown-up Hollywood spectacle that isn’t measured in the number of cities that get blown up, or the number superheroes you can cram into the frame, or how cleverly you can knit together a bunch of Steadicam shots to make a whole film seem continuous. </p>

<p>But you squandered my goodwill with your poor sleight-of-hand. In a film like this, the special effects should be invisible, but instead you’ve given them top billing above the stars, the script, and everything else.  </p>

    <id>www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/12/1/moana</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>When it comes to movies like <em>Moana</em>, I could write to the animation department or the songwriters till my fingers bleed. They make reviewing Disney films a piece of cake. That’s why writing to you is such a treat, Kalikolehua. Your role is so unusual, it’s ground-breaking. As community relations manager, you were in charge of translating the entire Polynesian culture to the big screen at a time where cultural exchange matters the most. </p>

<p>If there’s ever been a period in our history where racial sensitivity has been so prevalent, it’s 2016. It seems now as though all the progress that has been made in amending bias and prejudice is set to fall back 30 years. Having someone like you on staff, whose sole mission is to ensure that all racial sensitivities regarding the Polynesian people is noted and addressed, is a huge step forward, not only for Disney, but for all of us. </p>

<p><em>Moana</em> tells the story of Moana, a young girl who travels across the vast ocean in search of Maui, a shape-shifting demigod who has stolen a treasure that is causing all organic life on Moana’s home island to die. Along her journey, Moana faces roadblocks in the form of a giant crab, coconut pirates, and a gargantuan lava beast. </p>

<p>That synopsis alone raises some red flags on what could be deemed insensitive to the Polynesian people. Luckily, Disney did not reach into their old bag of <a href="http://screenrant.com/worst-racial-stereotypes-offensive-disney-movies-animation/">ignorance</a> for <em>Moana</em>. In addition in hiring you, Disney undertook months and months of intensive research of the Polynesian culture by forming the Oceania Trust, an advisory board of various Polynesian experts in history, linguistics, art, and more.</p>

<p>The Oceania Trust was called upon to provide direction on key decisions affecting <em>Moana</em>, like character <a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/comic-riffs/wp/2016/11/22/why-moanas-main-demigod-looks-so-much-and-so-little-like-peoples-sexiest-man-alive/">designs</a>, animated choreography sequences, and rectifying haphazard <a href="http://variety.com/2016/film/news/disney-moana-costume-pulled-after-complaints-1201868097/">marketing</a> tactics. You were the liaison between the Trust and the Studio and worked closely with the Trust in every aspect of the filmmaking process. You were ready to dive into the most detailed of concerns and tackle them head on, like deciding which textures were going to be used in the fabric of our main characters, or the symbolism behind Samoan tattoos. </p>

<p>Some might see this process as trivial, but when you’re trying to make a statement about respecting different cultures, it’s of the utmost importance.</p>

<p>And given <em>Moana</em> is an animated movie, the fact that Disney hired voice actors with Polynesian heritage makes the experience all the more impactful. Hollywood still has an issue with <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/2/29/gods-of-egypt.html">whitewashing</a>, so one would assume that an animated movie could get away with hiring white actors since they won’t physically be featured on screen--but not <em>Moana</em>. Dwayne Johnson, Nicole Scherzinger, Jemaine Clement, and newcomer Auli&#39;i Cravalho, all have Polynesian roots. </p>

<p>Your tireless efforts in representing the Polynesian community sounds like a daunting task but it’s all worth it in the end. <em>Moana</em> is a highly enjoyable addition to the Disney roster of films. It follows the same cadence as other Disney releases that feature a young girl on an adventure to find herself, yet the visual style, toe-tapping music, and attention to detail keep the format fresh and exciting. </p>

<p><em>Moana</em> could’ve been filled with island tropes involving hula skirts and tiki torches. Instead it’s a fantastic adventure that brings Polynesian traditions and mythology to a mass audience through song, dance, and heart. Thank you for your commitment to respecting the Polynesian past, present, and future.</p>

    <id>www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/11/23/two-lovers-and-a-bear</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Snow matters to Canadians. The volume, the consistency, the wetness, even the timing of it—these details actually affect our lives. So when we see that fake white fluff used by Hollywood, it’s an assault to the senses. If the environment rings false, it’s likely the emotions will, too. No such fears on the ultra-Canadian feature film <em>Two Lovers and Bear</em>, of course. In fact, the filmmakers went in the opposite direction; they shot primarily in Nunavut to create a chilling Northern experience that’s hard to shake. It actually feels like the most Canadian film ever. In all the good ways—and the bad. </p>

<p>Kim Nguyen’s follow-up to the haunting <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/10/5/war-witch-rebelle.html"><em>Rebelle</em></a> sees the writer/director tracking the story of a pair of Southern transplants trying to make a life in Canada’s North. Their dislocation is thematically important, and re-enforced by the disparate surroundings of Iqaluit. Part sanctuary, part purgatory, the snow you surround them with is sometimes a barrier from the outside world, and, at others, a connective tissue that enables 360-degree travel through the environment. And it’s during this snowmobiling section that the story finds its strongest pulse, actually gaining momentum and resonance in the last act. Plus some frighteningly real consequences from the cold. </p>

<p>You’ve <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0478317/?ref_=ttfc_fc_cr56">come a long way</a> from <em>The Day After Tomorrow,</em> Pierre. </p>

<p>To be sure, your job here was certainly not just to run behind the actors to cover their tracks on re-takes. There is some subtle fantasy in the film (revolving around the titular Bear) that elevates the material without ever losing the story’s firm grounding. That’s a big credit to you and the effects team, who blend the real and the digital so seamlessly that it left me questioning what’s real and what’s not—and that perfectly reflects the experience of the characters in the film.</p>

<p>But this wouldn’t be such a quintessential Canadian film if there weren’t the usual steadfast hallmarks: a loser male protagonist, a road trip, weird sex, snow shoes, and a doomed (or at the very least sobering) finale. Only this time those familiar beats don’t feel as formulaic (as rejections of Hollywood formulas), and actually come together with grace. I felt inspired and attracted to their relationship, which is largely due to the compelling talents of Dane DeHaan and Canadian treasure Tatiana Maslany. Throw in the pitch-perfect addition of Gordon Pinset, and it’s hard to think of a more Canadian creation.</p>

<p>Other than snow, of course.</p>

    <id>www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/11/22/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>You were a producer on every <em>Harry Potter</em> film, from <em>Sorcerer’s Stone</em> through to <em>Deathly Hallows -- Part 2: How Harry Got His Groove Back</em>. Now, five years after the credits rolled on the <em>Harry Potter</em> saga, you’re back as producer for the much-anticipated <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em>, an original screenplay from J.K. Rowling. Perhaps another addicting dose of the wizarding world was too much for you to resist. What would’ve made sense as a standalone film quickly became a Hollywood staple; a trilogy. And now, through serious magic withdrawal and an inability to admit you all have a problem, <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> has evolved into an exhaustive <a href="http://variety.com/2016/film/news/fantastic-beasts-and-where-to-find-them-five-movies-1201888226/">five-part</a> saga.</p>

<p>Hollywood has become a cesspool of prequels and sequels all tied together in the promise of a large story arc culminating in some sort of climax. Ever since the evil geniuses at Marvel Studios popularized the shared universe concept, no franchise has been safe--and <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> is the latest casualty.</p>

<p><em>Fantastic Beasts</em> is the untrue - yet true - story of Newt Scamander, the renowned “magizoologist” behind <em>Fantastic Beasts and Where to Find Them</em>, the textbook encyclopedia used by all wizards and witches when learning about magical beasts. It’s featured in <em>Harry Potter and the Sorcerer’s Stone</em> and was published as a hardcover book by J.K. Rowling. </p>

<p>For the most part, <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> is enjoyable but since it’s used as a launching pad for more movies rather than a solid standalone film, the story suffers. What was positioned as an Indiana Jones-style adventure with Newt exploring 1920’s New York City in search of a slew of beasts that escaped from his briefcase, is diminished in favour of a story that we’ve already seen in <em>Harry Potter 1-7</em>. <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> starts off strong but loses its way as the movie tries to squeeze in elements of muggle/magic relations, political drama, and dark magic courtesy of famed evil wizard, Grindelwald.</p>

<p>The first hour or so of <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> is, well, fantastic. The character design of the beasts is absolutely astounding. It’s a pleasant and refreshing reminder of the wonderful world that J.K. Rowling created, full of wonder and mystery. It’s charming and genuine. Newt Scamander is played excellently by Eddie Redmayne. He’s awkward and soft spoken, the type of lovable weirdo that feels more comfortable when he’s surrounded by his beasts than with other people. His interactions with his “No-maj” (American version of Muggle) companion, Kowalski, and his platypus/mole-inspired pet, <a href="http://harrypotter.wikia.com/wiki/Niffler">Niffler</a>, are a pure joy to watch. I would’ve liked nothing more than for that to be the entirety of the movie. </p>

<p>But you just couldn’t leave well enough alone, could you? When J.K. Rowling proposed shifting <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> into a five-part series, you should’ve fought back. It should’ve been a one-off that stayed true to itself and didn’t succumb to forced statements reflecting our current political landscape, and grandiose action sequences that had no place in this story. Seriously, what the hell was going on in the subway scene? </p>

<p>If you and the team really wanted to tell the story of Grindelwald and the tense relationship between muggles and magicians, you should’ve fought to make that its own saga. Sure, it would be just as many movies as the <em>Fantastic Beasts</em> five-parter but at least you’d be able to tell the full and complete story of two different characters rather than cramming them into one series and forcing them to play nice.</p>

<p>By the end, <em>Fantastic Beasts</em>strays so far away from what it was originally intended to be that the only recourse is a <em>deus ex machina</em> solution that creates more questions than answers.</p>

<p><em>Fantastic Beasts</em> is beaming with so much potential. It could’ve been a powerful standalone film that reinvigorated the franchise. You had the chance to start a conversation around topics only found in documentaries, such as animal rights, environmental impact, and our connection with nature. Instead, Fantastic Beasts ends up stripped of its magic.</p>

    <id>www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/11/21/billy-lynns-long-halftime-walk</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>While mulling over <em>Billy Lynn’s Long Halftime Walk</em>, the word ‘choreographed’ kept popping into my head. It made me think back to the dance lessons I took when I was a kid. When learning a routine, there was always a point at which I had performed the steps so many times I was dancing on autopilot, no longer thinking about what I was doing nor putting all that much care into it, just as long as I got it right enough that my teacher wouldn’t give me a hard time. The characters in Ang Lee’s film seem bound to a sort of choreography in much the same way; be it the soldiers on a PR tour, or the public that can’t thank them enough for their sacrifices. </p>

<p>On the surface, the garish explosion of Americana is hard to stomach. The film is a stone soup of every symbol of American jingoism you can think of: football, troops in uniform, Old Glory, cheerleaders, to name a few. The script is chock-full of tired, by-rote lines about duty, bravery, and gratitude for the troops’ sacrifice, all delivered in an almost mocking tone by the actors. </p>

<p>It would be too simplistic to say <em>Billy Lynn</em> accuses its characters, and by extension, its audience, of being false in their support for veterans or members of the armed forces. In fact it goes further, calling out a certain hypocrisy in which we go through the motions of ‘supporting the troops’ while ignoring the messier, more difficult aspects of their experiences. It joins films like <em>American Sniper</em> and <em>Flags of Our Fathers</em> in using stories of disillusioned and traumatized soldiers readjusting to civilian life to examine the hollowness of that much-performed phrase, “Support our troops.” </p>

<p>Ultimately, <em>Billy Lynn</em> is not simply about whether the admiration and gratitude for Billy and the rest of his unit are genuine. Instead, it picks apart the various displays of ‘support’ for these men in uniform, framing it as an unbalanced, selfish exchange wherein support for the troops isn’t so much about giving something to them as it is about wanting something from them. Every exchange Billy and his fellow soldiers have with civilian characters is framed this way: someone thanks them, and tells them how brave they are, and then asks them for something, callously pushing them to recount and relive battlefield trauma to provide vicarious thrills, to make <em>themselves</em> feel noble and generous for supporting the troops. The insensitivity shown to Billy and his unit goes from amusingly awkward to straight-up heartbreaking, culminating in a halftime pyrotechnics display that takes the men right back to the battlefield. </p>

<p>There are moments when Billy and his sergeant attempt genuine, unchoreographed expression, desperation creeping around the edges of their features as they try to connect to people with the unadorned truth of their experience, their fear, and their doubt. These attempts are received with discomfort and disappointment; no one likes the guy who falls out of step while everyone else is going through the motions in perfect synch with empty stage grins plastered across their faces. No one wants inglorious truth when we can drape it in red, white, and blue bunting and parade it around a football field with Beyoncé. As a pushy Hollywood producer tells Billy’s unit, fresh from a horrific battle and burying one of their own, they make people feel good about America again. Lee brings his film to a bleak, unflattering conclusion; it isn’t about thanking the troops for their service, it’s about how that show of gratitude makes us feel about ourselves. </p>

    <id>www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/11/18/bleed-for-this</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>The aural palette of <em>Bleed For This</em> is drenched in screaming technicolor; the thud of leather forcefully applied to flesh, the cacophony of an entire working class Italian family at a kitchen table in a room smaller than the average bathroom, the splintering noise of a head on car collision. All of this underscores an environment rich in a sort of carnival atmosphere that perfectly captures the world of boxing in the Eighties and early Nineties.</p>

<p><em>Bleed For This</em> tells the story of boxer Vinnie (Paz) Pazienza. In the early Nineties, as his career seemed to be flagging, he made an unprecedented jump of two weight classes to super middleweight and surprised everyone by winning the IBF championship. But shortly after that triumph he was involved in a catastrophic car wreck. Most of the film concerns itself with his attempt to return to boxing despite coming very close to being paralyzed.</p>

<p>What <em>Bleed For This</em> gets mostly right is the working-class roots and unrepentant hucksterism of boxing, especially in its depiction of the father-son team of boxing promoters, Lou and Dan Duva. They are a family that could give The Krays a run in the cold-blooded opportunist category. Completely unconcerned with the welfare of the boxers they promote, once they recognize the public’s renewed interest in Paz, the Duva’s happily jump at the chance to promote his first return bout—despite the close to 50/50 chance Paz may end up paralyzed.</p>

<p>So much about boxing, especially in the Eighties and Nineties, was the sports equivalent of a carny convention, and <em>Bleed For This</em> captures this perfectly. Uniformly the performances manage to walk the line between depicting almost cartoonish personalities while still imbuing them with a real humanity. Miles Teller has always struck me as a poor man’s Shia LaBeouf, but as Paz he is note-perfect. As an Italian working class man who becomes one of the premiere boxers in the world (but still lives with his parents), Teller manages to capture the paradox of a man with child-like qualities as well as the brutal arrogance necessary to thrive in the world of boxing. An almost unrecognizable Aaron Eckhart as Kevin Rooney (Mike Tyson’s former trainer) is perfect as an avatar of the kind of man that boxing often produces—broken alcoholics that also sometimes rise above their own baser instincts.</p>

<p>What <em>Bleed For This</em> doesn’t do particularly well is actual boxing. Unlike films like <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/8/8/southpaw.html"><em>Southpaw</em></a> or <em>The Fighter</em>, which had leads that could sell the idea of something resembling real boxing, this film feels more like Rocky and its heightened and often Hollywood portrayal of what happens in the ring. Teller just doesn’t manage to pull off the physicality necessary to make this feel real. Visually this film was competent and workmanlike, but it never soared.</p>

<p>Amazingly, none of this stops <em>Bleed For This</em> from working pretty well. It truly captures the odd world that boxing occupies, at least outside the ring—a world filled with a soundscape composed of equal parts tragedy and farce.</p>

    <id>www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/11/17/arrival</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>I made a bold claim this summer: <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/7/26/my-de-palma-is-better-than-your-de-palma.html">“When the end of the year arrives and we start compiling our lists of the best films of the year, <em>De Palma </em>will be at the top of mine.”</a> Like many of the cavalier, self-satisfied predictions made by the media about how 2016 would turn out, mine, too, has been proven catastrophically false. </p>

<p>A professional media specialist like you might find it laughable that someone could watch <em>this</em> movie – a sci-fi blockbuster about the sudden appearance of giant potato chip-shaped spaceships at scenic locations across the globe – and claim to have experienced something akin to epiphany. But it’s true. I did. I was so deeply moved by this movie that upon leaving the theater I had that rare feeling – the feeling we all seek when interacting with art – of having gained some profound new understanding of the world around me. Both its cruelty and grace. </p>

<p>It’s a difficult experience to defend. Particularly in a critical review, which, my colleagues have recently reminded me, should be <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/7/27/there-are-two-ways-to-watch-a-film-and-the-other-one-is-wrong.html">an act of discipline towards</a> (<a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/7/27/the-rashomon-effect.html">and not an indulgence of</a>) one’s aesthetic subjectivity. I am self-conscious that the experience I had with this film might be impossible to reproduce. So I won’t try to describe it to you. Instead I will share with you the simple philosophical idea around which the film (for me) revolved: the experience of agony is a worthwhile price to pay for the experience of joy. </p>

<p>This idea is powerfully expressed through one particular element of the plot. But it wasn’t the mechanics of that plot element that got to me; I figured out the “twist” long before the characters onscreen do (which is to say, long before director Denis Villeneuve and screenwriter Eric Heisserer make it explicit) and so was able to watch the pieces of the puzzle slowly come together (in fact, the reveal, delivered in subtitles, feels sort of awkward). But my epiphany had nothing to do with the satisfaction of solving a puzzle. It was the diegetic context in which that problem was solved; the thing that eventually happens to main character, the decision she must make.</p>

<p>And it wasn’t just the <em>fact</em> of that thing happening, or the consequences of that decision, but the way it was brought to life onscreen. The moments I’m talking about – which occur far away from the looming spaceships and the armies gathered around them – are so beautiful, so real, so <em>true</em>, so well-crafted by cinematographer Bradford Young, that they have become, in my memory, the entire film. Forget the amazing special effects, the topsy-turvy physics and cephalopod aliens and supernatural sunrise vistas—the image that sticks with me is a little girl collecting rocks on a shoreline. </p>

<p>It was that quiet moment (and those like it) that simultaneously crushed and inspired me. As a husband, and father, and member of the human race. And maybe that’s why <em>Arrival</em> feels so special: that unique commixture of being crushed and inspired. It’s so easy to make people sad; <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/9/14/amour.html">there</a> <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/1/15/45-years-is-ununconditionally-the-best-film-of-2015.html">are</a> <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/3/29/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice.html">countless</a> films that traffic in tragedy and heartsickness the way horror movies traffic in frights and comedies traffic in laughs. But rarely is that grief tempered with such optimism. Awful things happen in <em>Arrival</em>, and you’re glad that they did. Because, yes, the experience of agony is a worthwhile price to pay for the experience of joy. </p>

    <id>www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/11/8/doctor-strange</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>There’s an interesting line in the first act of Marvel’s latest blockbuster, delivered by a character named The Ancient One (whose ancientness and oneness with the universe are pretty convincingly embodied by an even paler-than-usual Tilda Swinton), in which she compares the casting of spells to the writing of computer code. To paraphrase: the universe has rules, and those rules are determined by a programming language; learn to speak that language, and you can bend – and even change – those rules. </p>

<p>Small ideas like this are at the core of Marvel’s success on the big screen. The spell the studio casts is one of backwards rationalization; they’re able to retrofit characters and motivations and circumstances in order to turn even the goofiest, anachronistic superheroes into completely relevant modern characters. <em>Doctor Strange</em> is a perfect example. The Sorcerer Supreme was the product of a very specific time in American history: the counterculture of the 1960s was steeped in hallucinatory drugs and Eastern philosophy. To capitalize, Steve Ditko and Stan Lee created a character who embodied (albeit indirectly) some of the far-out principles that fuelled that movement: a former doctor who has dropped out, tuned in, turned on, learned black magic in Kathmandu, and spent his subsequent free time hanging out in the psychedelic multiverse. The book, as expected, became a favourite of college students and Hare Krishna converts alike. </p>

<p>And yet, in this new film, released a half-century later, Dr. Strange still feels like a manifestation of contemporary zeitgeist: he’s a reformed materialist, a converted skeptic, an obsessive autodidact, a mystic technologist—a sort of occult Mark Zuckerberg. He must protect the world from supernatural terrorist threats, and struggles with how much of his own moral capital he must spend in order to do so. Like the best Marvel characters, his heroism doesn’t come from a place of self-righteousness – he’s not born into spandex, like some Amazonian Princess or crash-landed alien immigrant – but from internal struggle. Peter Parker is crippled by guilt, Tony Stark is an alcoholic, and Stephen Strange...well, he’s kind of a self-centered dick.</p>

<p>So, yes, the filmmakers have done their due diligence in justifying the existence of this movie in the year 2016. But what about the movie itself? And what does all this have to do with you, Gina?</p>

<p>Well, you’re somewhat of a magician, too. And the visions you’ve helped conjure in the many scenes of kaleidoscopic head-tripping are genuinely spectacular (which is significant if only for the fact that we live in an age of perpetual, exhausting spectacle). Cities fold in upon themselves, the pandemonium of a collapsing building occurs in reverse, bodies cartwheel through weird fractal space-tunnels. Throughout all this, you apply your craft meticulously; single frames stretched and smudged and painted over to ensure that the tumbling, floating, kung-fu-fighting figures are interacting realistically with their environments. And, with the exception of some cartoonish contortions during the fight sequences, it pays off. </p>

<p>So, in that sense, Doctor Strange, as a superhero blockbuster, excels where it needs to. It’s epic, it’s loud, it’s funny, it’s efficient. But, Gina, the magic you exercise in bringing to life the physics of the world is missing entirely from the screenplay. It seems like such a generic complaint, I know, and sort of unfair, because who comes to see a superhero film for subtext and nuance? Even the best superhero flicks – <em>The Dark Knight,</em> <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/5/11/the-avengers.html"><em>The Avengers</em></a> – are speaking a language that is necessarily preposterous. But there is room in this genre, I think, for films like this one to eschew tradition and find new ways to build character, incite conflict, and resolve that conflict; there doesn’t <em>always</em> need to be an <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/8/10/suicide-squad.html">impenetrable garbage storm</a> swirling over a world capital. </p>

<p>Marvel has done this to themselves: they’ve set the bar so high that I’m finding it harder and hard to forgive this kind of middling entertainment. <em>Doctor Strange</em> aspires, in some scenes, to Shakespearian gravitas, and in others to Whedon-esque burlesque. And throughout it all, there’s the usual superabundance of exposition to correctly place this film and its characters in the increasingly complicated constellation of the Marvel Cinematic Universe, which is also known as the MCU, and the fact that this is both a proper noun and an acronym should give you a sense of how, in these films, the bigger picture can take priority over little details like character development and pace and motivation and resolution in these individual films—they’re just building blocks, after all. One gets the sense, walking out of <em>Doctor Strange</em>, that you’ve just watched a two hour-long deleted scene from the next Avengers movie.</p>

<p>I like that idea of magic being akin to writing computer code. And the way that idea is expressed onscreen, with specific movements and visual cues (eg. swirled fingers open up teleportation portals) puts reasonable parameters around the notion that these characters can do virtually <em>anything</em>. And I like the work that you did, Gina, to bring all that <em>anything</em> to life. It made me believe, for those two hours, in magic. I just wished that such care was applied to making me believe the thoughts and feelings and actions of the characters who were practicing that magic. </p>
