    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>You’ve made up a lot of Hollywood’s most famous faces, so I doubt that you’re ever star-struck. Still, you must get a bit of a thrill being hired to ply your craft on one of the most beautiful women in the world (even if this isn’t the first time). That is, it must have been thrilling until you read the script for <em>The Secret in Their Eyes</em>. Much of the movie has Julia not just glammed-down, but nearly <em>unrecognizable</em>. </p>

<p>This might seem derisive, but it certainly seems like the tired cliché of “pretty star gets drastic make-under in hopes of snagging an Oscar nom” applies here.  </p>

<p>In fact, the whole movie feels like one big “for your consideration” promo reel. </p>

<p>The original 2009 Argentinian film, <em>The Secret in Their</em> <em>Eyes</em>, already won the Academy Award for Best Foreign Film, and deservedly so. It manages a delicate but assured balance between being a taut thriller, unrequited love story, and nuanced character study that haunts you long after the credits have rolled. Americanizing <em>The Secret in Their Eyes</em> is an idea that works better in theory than in practice. Like the folly of trying to apply makeup in a speeding car, all you end up with is a pretty mess. </p>

<p>The foundation is there: it’s 2003, Ray is an FBI agent sent to L.A. to work for the newly formed Department of Homeland Security. His partner is Jess, a sharp investigator and dedicated single mom. When Jess’ daughter Carolyn is discovered murdered beside a mosque the team has been investigating, Ray’s failure to bring the murderer to justice threatens to upend the Department’s operation. Twelve years later, Ray, returns to L.A., convinced he has found Carolyn’s murderer, and enlists the help of Claire, his former co-worker and unrequited love, who is now the District Attorney.</p>

<p>This movie <em>looks</em> good. Too good. The Homeland Security offices are artfully disheveled, the walls covered in boutique hotel paintings, the file boxes stacked just so; it <em>should</em> seem real, yet it all somehow feels as though the art department has spray cans of Hollywood Gloss with which they liberally coat each set. Even the grit feels faux. The leads, Chiwetel Ejiofor as Ray, and Nicole Kidman as Claire, are fantastic actors and even more fantastically good looking, but they share exactly zero chemistry, rendering their will-they-won’t-they subplot as translucent as your finishing powder. </p>

<p>Julia Roberts does stand out here—and I don’t just mean figuratively. When the film flashes back to 2003, we see the Julia Roberts audiences know and love – pretty, perky: America’s Sweetheart. When the film follows her into present day, it’s painful to see the effect the events of the film have had on her. You give her dark circles under her eyes, a sallow complexion and hollow sockets. Jess is a shell of her former self. She is hunched over and walks like a wounded animal. Robert’s performance of a long-grieving mother is heartbreaking, yes, but we’re never able to forget that it’s <em>Julia Roberts</em>. As anyone who rolled their eyes at the no-makeup selfie trend would know, it’s obvious when something is trying too hard to look “real.” </p>

<p>Writer/Director Billy Ray has had success in the past with cerebral adult thrillers, namely his work on <em>Shattered Glass</em>, <em>State of Play</em>, and <em>Captain Phillips</em>, all of which boasted stripped-down veracity and multi-layered characters searching for some intangible truth. None of that honesty is on display here. The dialogue tries alternately to be flip and trenchant, and often fails at both. Danny Moder’s cinematography does it’s best to operate around the bland staging, and if it wasn’t for the top-notch cast – which is rounded out by Alfred Molina, Dean Norris, and Michael Kelly – the whole thing would read as a particularly convoluted, high-pedigree police procedural. </p>

<p>When you were a very little girl did you ever put makeup on yourself? The lipstick ends up clownish, the eye shadow is exaggerated, and the blush is severe. Which isn’t surprising when the elements are applied with such a heavy hand. It seems the same technique was employed here: so much fuss to make something that was already beautiful less remarkable. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>I love disaster movies, don’t you? Especially the ones “based on actual events”. I love disasters so much that when I saw <em>Titanic</em> I planned to nap through the first half’s lovey-dovey romantic subplot and told my friend to wake me up for the iceberg. I’m such a fan of the TV show <em>Mayday</em> that I actually have a <em>favourite plane crash</em> (Potomac River, Air Florida, 1982). There’s something about watching a dramatized real-life horrific event that appeals to my love of the underdog. It’s fascinating to watch regular people find the strength to survive. But I have a feeling that you watch these movies with a different perspective.</p>

<p>You’ve worked on other films and television series, but I bet doing health &amp; safety for a film whose entire plot relies on the very lack of workplace health and safety gave you an added sense of purpose. In 2010, 33 Chilean miners were trapped more than a kilometer underground after a series of mine collapses. Miraculously, they survived for more than two months before their heroic rescue. <em>The 33</em> chronicles their story.</p>

<p>You don’t have a job that allows you to blithely gloss over details and say, “meh, good enough”, but it seems the writers of <em>The 33</em> don’t share that sentiment. Ordinarily I have a very difficult time overcoming a conceit which sees a group of Spanish actors, playing Chileans, speaking English with Spanish accents. I cringe when the first few minutes of a film sets up so many clichéd scenarios – the miner two weeks from retirement, the miner considering changing jobs before the birth of his child, the miner who has the day off but volunteers to work anyway – that I half expect a baby-faced soldier to pull out a picture of his “girl back home”. But I forgive these trivialities the same way I forgave white people playing Spanish people in <em>Alive</em> and <em>The Impossible,</em> because, impending disaster!</p>

<p>You are responsible for assessing risks, identifying hazards and recommending safety measures. Your job is the most important on the set, but you still have to answer to the director, and hope that he or she is just as committed to the safety of the cast and crew. In <em>The 33</em>, your job is done by Lou Diamond Phillips, as the safety foreman Don, his complaints to the higher ups about an impending catastrophe have fallen on deaf ears. When the inevitable happens, it is indeed terrifying, but quick. The real drama begins after the miners realize they are trapped with only enough supplies for ten men for three days. </p>

<p>Above ground, the families, led by a defiant Juliette Binoche as Maria, the estranged sister of one of the miners, demand the foot-dragging government spare no expense in attempting to free the miners. But after more than two weeks with no luck, everyone is about to give up hope. Except for “Super” Mario Sepulveda played by Spanish Harrison Ford, Antonio Banderas. As the de facto leader, Mario keeps the men’s spirits up, divvies up their dwindling supplies, and argues with Don over what they should do next. In one of the film’s best scenes, Mario serves up the last of the food and we are treated to a dream sequence involving their wives and girlfriends feeding them their favourite dishes. Normally this kind of chauvinistic scenario would make me cringe, but it was so well imagined and executed that it intensified the impact of the miner’s dire situation, and humanized the otherwise flat characterizations. </p>

<p><em>The 33</em> gets really interesting when the miners are discovered alive. This is when the whole world gets involved. Engineers, oil rig drills, extraction experts and news pundits from around the globe all have suggestions about how to get the men out. I wonder, did you watch the drama as it unfolded in real time and imagine how you might proceed if you were there? The collapse has displaced a rock right beside the miner’s position that is twice the size of the Empire State Building and twice as hard as granite. Even though the miners are able to receive supplies and communicate with their loved ones, it becomes apparent that the risks of attempting a rescue may put the miners in even more danger. </p>

<p>If a “true story” disaster movie is really good –think <em>Touching the Void</em>, or <em>United 93</em> - it doesn’t matter if you know the outcome. Kind of like your job – you know you’ve doing it right when there are no surprises. But keeping up an exciting level of suspense is only half the battle. Perhaps because the story of <em>The 33</em> is still fresh in the public consciousness, or perhaps because it relies more on sentimentality than on veracity, it manages only a pedestrian level of tension. <em>The 33</em> is a predictable film with a lot of heart. Just wish the filmmakers hadn’t played it so safe.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>I should really schedule an appointment to see you, but that might be tough. Between publishing books on complex trauma, holding workshops across North America, and coaching soon-to-be A-list actresses like Brie Larson, you’ve got a full dance card. Still, I need to talk to someone.  <em>Room</em> is a hard film to shake. Which is strange - most of your work is about helping people out of incredibly dark places. But in this case, you did the opposite. You threw us into it.</p>

<p>Thank you.</p>

<p>It’s a testament to director Lenny Abrahamson’s approach that he brought you on set. After his previous film <em>Frank</em>, a lighter look at a self-imposed form of entrapment, Abrahamson obviously wanted to help his team understand what it would truly be like to be locked in a room for seven years. Thankfully, not many people can relate. Having the book’s original author Emma Donoghue adapt her original story into a screenplay was another way to preserve the material’s emotional authenticity. But the success of <em>Room</em> comes down to tone and mood – which, I’m sure you appreciate, can make a world of difference when dealing with difficult subject matter.</p>

<p>I went into <em>Room</em> with some weighty expectations. My populist taste puts a lot of credence in the audience award at the Toronto International Film Festival – not to mention the fact I have a well-documented affinity for Canadian film. So imagine my glee at finally seeing a film that checks both those boxes. Not loving it would have been its own personal trauma – or at least an existential crisis. And while it admittedly took me some time to calm the cheerleading voice in my brain and judge the film on its own merit, I was unquestionably swept up with emotion at the exact moment I was probably supposed to – the truck.  In a scene loaded with re-traumatizing images, but also life affirming hope, it was to my surprise delight, only partway through the journey.</p>

<p>See, in the same way someone in recovery tries to avoid triggering flashbacks, my routine is to literally avert my eyes and cover my ears during previews for films I plan to see. I don’t want to be watching a film with images of the trailer running through my mind, anticipating upcoming plot twists or character developments. Like Larson’s character, I want to create a new reality free of expectations to re-discover child-like wonder. Now that I have a kid getting old enough to watch films, again, like Larson’s character, that’s getting easier. Not that I would bring him to see <em>Room</em> – that will ignite conversations I hope are still years away. But for the adult, parental me, it was certainly more uplifting and entertaining than a stale lecture on the subject of traumatization (no offense). And connecting to this material was much more of a joy than I expected.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>You evil, evil bastard. All this bloodshed over the course of four long years has just been a game to you, hasn’t it? Yeah sure, you were just doing your job, using the manipulated spectacle of teenage deaths to pacify the masses, but did you ever stop to think about the consequences of your involvement in the project? No, really. I’m not just comparing you to the evil game makers within the world of <em>The Hunger Games</em> – I’m talking about your real-life job with this franchise. The one where you and your merchandising masters cram in on-screen action that’s more appealing to the consumer video game market. I could feel your sweaty little button pushing fingers everywhere.</p>

<p>Don’t get me wrong, I didn’t need the love triangle storyline between Katniss, Peta and Gale dragged out any more than it has been. I actually looked forward to the much-promised action sequences of storming the Capitol and wreaking retribution against President Snow. The only problem is, there came a point where I could feel the filmmakers hearts weren’t in this story for the thrills. The action was often treated like a necessary evil to appease the demands of big budget studio filmmaking. </p>

<p>Look no further than the film’s reverse action movie structure, which opens small and closes small, only cramming in action to the middle sections to pad the already stretched exposition. In almost every other action series, that formula is reversed. <em>Mission: Impossible</em>, James Bond,<em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> – they all rely on opening with a grand stunt to set the stage for what’s to come. <em>Mockingjay,</em>both parts, actually, go in the opposite direction. Both cold opens linger on the psychological effects that killing and manipulation has had on its characters. It’s actually a refreshing change of pace. But it also is an implicit statement of where the heart of the franchise lies – and it is surely not in escaping mutated monsters that are given absolutely no context within the film. In fact, I have a strong feeling they were cooked up by one of your gaming programmers as an easy-to-kill foe that can be cloned and repeated in whatever video game spin-off this series spits out.</p>

<p>The rest of the action, however, feels much truer to the spirit of the franchise. In theory, <em>Mockingjay Part 2</em> finds a way to shoe-horn in the idea of violence as spectacle with President Snow saying he’ll film the invasion and subsequent quashing of the rebels to help propagandize his cause. So the hidden booby-traps spread around the city are at least motivated by some internal logic, and lead to some exciting and consequential scenes. But action in the<em>The Hunger Games</em> series is only effective as an expression of love, and that gets harder to swallow when Katniss starts engaging in <em>Avengers</em>-level invincibility against the sewer monsters (who, truth to be told, look pretty great).</p>

<p>It’s probably not fair for me to pin all the film’s short comings on an admittedly small section of the film. The series definitely suffered by splitting up these final two films, and expecting a casual audience to have thought of this world at all in between. So by the time I felt caught up with all the personal dynamics, it already felt too late. Too many characters were only given a token amount of screen time, to the point their inclusion felt more like fan-service than smart storytelling. Not to mention the eeriness of seeing a resurrected Philip Seymour Hoffman sleepwalking through a thankless role (with only one situation that felt like a CGI manipulation). </p>

<p>The film was strongest when it rejected the idea of the games altogether. Plotlines about refugees and asylum seekers from the Capitol can’t help but evoke reminders of the people from Syria, and it’s a credit to <em>The Hunger Games</em> that none of these issues are given an easy solution. The rejection of being treated like pawns, even when it’s proven effective, elevates the material beyond what you’d expect to be directed at teenagers. It would have been nice if you and your team had followed suit.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>And here I thought <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/10/20/pan.html">Kurt Cobain</a> was going to be the most surprising credit of the year.</p>

<p>Seeing your name in the end credits of Steven Spielberg’s <em>Bridge of Spies</em> threw me for a loop. As you are no doubt well aware, <em>Bridge of Spies</em> is only the second Spielberg feature <em>not</em> scored by John Williams. The other was <em>The Color Purple</em>, which was scored by Quincy Jones. I know, I know, you’re a six-time Grammy winner and a 12-time Oscar nominee. You’re certainly not an unknown quantity. But Jones has won 27 Grammys and been nominated 79 times, while Williams has won 5 Oscars, been nominated 44 times, and has also won 22 Grammys himself. You’re stepping in to replace two men who are basically the most recognized artists in your field. That’s a tall step.</p>

<p>And it&#39;s not that you don’t have your own impressive film credentials: <em>American Beauty</em>, <em>Finding</em> <em>Nemo</em>, <em>Skyfall</em>, and <em>WALL•E,</em> just to name only a few. But it’s not your pedigree that that makes you an unusual choice. It’s your musical style.</p>

<p>Let’s face it: you aren’t known as being the most emotional of composers. My introduction to your music was Robert Altman’s <em>The Player</em>, where the electronic iciness and ironic detachment was a perfect accompaniment to Altman’s black comedy. And even as you’ve worked on higher-budget, higher-profile productions, you’ve maintained some of that signature aloofness, almost always to the benefit of your collaborators.</p>

<p>And here you are, working with Steven Spielberg, considered by many—unfairly, at times—as one of the most sentimental filmmakers of all time. The natural question is: how does this affect <em>Bridge of Spies</em>? Is a Spielberg movie a different experience when John Williams isn’t delivering his bombastic brass or swelling strings? </p>

<p>Yes. And no.</p>

<p>The music <em>is</em> different. This may be Spielberg’s least-scored film since <em>Saving Private Ryan</em>. It’s a welcome change, as his most recent film, <em>Lincoln</em> – <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/11/16/lincoln.html">which I loved</a> – leaned too heavily on mawkish cues that it didn’t need. Here, you do your best to maintain some distance from the events onscreen, which gives everything an icy sheen entirely appropriate to a story set during the Cold War. </p>

<p>Though inspired by actual events, <em>Bridge of</em> <em>Spies</em> is a deceptively simple film in terms of plot. In 1957, Rudolph Able, a Russian deep-cover operative, is arrested by the CIA after retrieving a dead drop package. American lawyer James Donovan is asked to defend him—but only <em>just</em> enough to give the appearance of due process. Not long afterwards, US Air Force pilot Francis Powers is captured in Russia while flying a covert operation to film military sites. Donovan is then asked to facilitate a prisoner swap between the two nations, Abel for Powers. </p>

<p>It’s all classic spy stuff, but Spielberg treats it all matter-of-factly and without fuss. Although it’s beautifully shot (by Janusz Kaminski, of course; Williams is the only of Spielberg’s regulars absent here), one would be hard-pressed to find what could be called “typical” Spielberg shots; there’s nary a <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VS5W4RxGv4s">Spielberg Face</a> to be found.  Even Tom Hanks subdues his natural warmth and charisma, playing Donovan as a man more annoyed than honored by his nation’s call to duty. </p>

<p>And this, Thomas, is why your music fits so well.</p>

<p><em>Bridge of Spies</em> is an inward-looking film. It’s telling that the first shot of the film is one of Able peering into a mirror, studying his own face. This is a story about the way we see ourselves – as people, as nations – and how we present ourselves to the world. Able may be a spy, but he is an honest one: once caught, he readily admits who he is and what he’s done. He’s not going to give up any Soviet secrets, but he’s also not going to pretend he doesn’t have them. For Donovan, this is far more admirable than what his own government is asking. His own moral compass won’t let him do what his country demands, and must deal with the consequences of the way this action (or inaction) is perceived. </p>

<p>You music takes it’s cue from Able: quiet, introspective, but sure of its place and purpose. It doesn’t need to be showy. And Like Mark Rylance’s superb performance as the captured spy, it puts us at a remove, free of emotional manipulation. And that’s no small feat.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>It’s no secret that the holiday season brings out the worst in consumer culture. The moment the clock strikes midnight on October 31st, stores quickly fill every nook and cranny with winter-themed tchotchkes in order to get a jumpstart on their competition. As Assistant Property Manager, it’s your job to bring that forced holiday cheer to the big screen.</p>

<p><em>Love The Coopers</em> is but the first of many holiday films to be released in 2015. Using the same concept as most seasonal bangers in the past (<em>Family Stone, New Years Eve, Valentine’s Day</em>,) <em>Love The Coopers </em>employs a star-studded cast in order to put asses in seats and be the first to welcome you to the holiday season. </p>

<p>And as we’ve learned from internet commenters, being first doesn’t justify anything. When the tinsel has settled, it’s glaringly apparent that <em>Love</em> <em>The</em> <em>Coopers </em>is just another PG-13 comedy about a zany family having to deal with one another during the holidays. There are contrived laughs to uphold its light-hearted conceit, and occasional bouts of emotions sprinkled on top to surprise us—until the family dog jumps on the table causing everyone to yell and be dysfunctional. It’s a stencilled formula that we’ve grown accustomed to dealing with for a month or two, just like the sad men in Santa outfits, busy malls, and rows and rows of packed shelves holding lame trinkets.</p>

<p>The type of trinkets that make one wonder, “do people actually buy these?”.</p>

<p>Apparently they do. You had the presumably unfortunate job of sourcing these trinkets to create a life-like scenario of what we experience at the end of every year. As we saw during our visit to the part-time job of Lauren Hesselberg—the awkward teenage crush for Ed Helms’ son; thousands of red, white and green streamers along with Santa dolls filling a shop aisle are an inescapable truth. No matter how lame and gaudy they are, they seem to show up every year—just like cheesy holiday movies. </p>

<p>If red Starbuck cups have taught us anything, it’s that making changes to a time-honored tradition can create backlash, despite how trivial it may be. It’s almost become mechanical: every year, a handful of holiday movies appear and every year, Assistant Property Masters like you will run out to prop warehouses, crank open the giant doors and pull out a disheveled plastic Rudolph tangled in Christmas lights and feathered white boas. But that’s the nature of the job I suppose. </p>

<p>Commercialization of the holidays has been around for many years, and it will no doubt continue for many more. And in a strange twist of fate, it means you will always have income around this time of year to spend on your family. And isn’t that what the holidays are all about?</p>

You have to be there before the sun is up, ready to provide coffee, juice and sad Costco Danish for the bleary-eyed cast and crew when they arrive. Sometimes, though, being alone on set must be kind of peaceful. You get to have the location to yourself before the other trucks arrive, and you can take your time setting up before the mad rush of shooting begins. Other times it must be a little bit creepy. Especially when your location is in the middle of nowhere. I mean, anything could be out there in the woods. Anything. </p>

<p>That is the premise of <em>Man Vs,</em> a horror/psychological thriller set on a remote island on the Canadian Shield. The titular man is Doug Woods, a survivalist and star of <em>Woods vs,</em> a television show in the vein of <em>Survivorman</em>, that sees Doug left in the woods with little more than a camera and his wits with which to survive for five days. When his small crew drops him off, they remind him that this new season is their chance to get a network deal – a not-so-subtle suggestion to amp up the stakes of the show. Once on the island, Doug begins to fear that he is not alone, but who, or what exactly is out there with him?</p>

<p>One of the benefits of working on a relatively small production must be that most days you serve the same people. No crowd scenes means no background to have to prepare food for, which makes your life easier. But to satisfy the same group over and over means you have to be, um <em>crafty</em>. <em>Man Vs</em>, faces the same obstacle. Fans of the horror/thriller genre are a tough bunch to please.  But at the same time, they are among some of the most forgiving. If the story is strong they are willing to overlook a boom mike in shot or a clumsy overdub. Not that they have to worry about that here. <em>Man Vs</em> is a low-budget film, but it isn’t cheap. </p>

<p>In the same way you can probably feed a hundred people when you’re only budgeted for seventy-five, <em>Man Vs</em> is creative. It uses tropes we are familiar with – survivalist reality TV, horror, action – and delivers a lean and pretty compelling story. We never doubt that Doug, played with equal amounts TV host-smarm and genuine terror by Chris Diamantopoulos, is at home in the wilderness. When strange things start to happen on the second day – dead fish in the river, a huge chunk of the tree line demolished – he rationalizes it away. But when things get seriously weird we begin to wonder – is it Duncan, the creepy scout the production team hired to bring Doug to the island? Is it the team screwing with Doug to boost the show’s ratings? Is Doug losing his mind? Or is it something else entirely?  </p>

<p>The film clips along at a steadily intensifying pace, and Diamantopoulos revs up his fear accordingly. He is the only person on screen for the majority of the film (much of which is him filming himself for the show with a Go-Pro), and manages that responsibility deftly. <em>Man Vs</em> has a few “as if” moments, like there are in most films of this ilk, but nothing serious enough to derail the premise. In the last third of the film, when we finally see what is versus man, it’s genuinely chilling. Like the organic chocolate chip cookies you hoard for the crew members that help you wash dishes, it’s important not to give too much away. </p>

<p>Feeding people is easy, but actually satisfying them is harder than it looks. Too many horror/psychological thriller films go for the “more is more” approach, leaving audiences starved for narrative. <em>Man Vs</em> has a simple premise, but that it has a smart and tight script, shot economically with a compelling lead and blessedly sparing use of visual effects and still manages to be an ultimately disturbing movie is crafty indeed.</p>

    <title>Spotlight</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Sometimes life can correct art. In season five of <em>The Wire</em> you played an investigative reporter who spun stories out of whole cloth just to boost your signal in the newsroom of the Baltimore Sun. Now, seven years later, you co-write and direct a film about the investigative arm of the Boston Globe (dubbed Spotlight) that literally changed the world. Because of the series of stories that the Globe published in the early 2000’s—stories that detail decades of sexual abuse by priests as well as the Catholic Church’s implication in a massive cover up—millions of people would come to reassess their relationship with the church, as well as with the people who are its ostensible guardians.</p>

<p><em>Spotlight</em> is a reversion to a kind of filmmaking that has often been declared dead and buried by countless (and as it turns out, alarmist) think pieces. Thoughtful and nuanced, the story spools out effortlessly. The performances are low key and far less heightened than most films that are trumpeted as Oscar bait. This is a true ensemble piece with strong turns from Mark Ruffalo, Michael Keaton, Rachel MacAdams and Liev Schreiber—not to mention stellar work from Stanley Tucci in a small, but vital, performance. </p>

<p>The filmmaking itself is invisible—a return to the kind of aesthetic that made films like <em>All The Presidents Men</em> or even <em>The French Connection</em> feel like they were one degree away from real. In the same way that well written dialogue goes unnoted, the audience is completely unaware of the architecture of the work and is left to simply absorb the narrative. Much like last year’s <em>A Most Violent Year</em> or even <em>Timbuktu</em>, <em>Spotlight</em> is a medium budget film that puts lie to the idea that there is no such thing as adult entertainment that doesn’t end with the suffix <strong>hub</strong>.</p>

<p>It is a subtle pleasure to watch something so carefully modulated. There are very few moments of high drama. Instead we all get to see how the sausage is made—the whole movie gives itself over to the fascinating process of how a story so monumental is found in nooks and crannies, detail by detail—by professionals who are dedicated to their craft. And the resulting piece of art is completely riveting.</p>

<p><em>Spotlight</em> is a clear example of how film can parse fraught and incendiary themes with intelligence and sensitivity. You managed a balance between blunt truths and an understanding that these are real people, not just mannequins you rearrange to create narrative flourishes. Nor is <em>Spotlight</em> an instrument of advocacy other than demonstrating the value of an increasingly rare sort of journalistic enterprise. Everyone populating the landscape you helped create were characters with complicated, and often conflicted, motivations and desires.</p>

<p><em>Station Agent,</em> a film of yours I happened across years ago, is an intimate, small-scale  funny/sad story about a group of socially ill-equipped humans finding community with one another—and in so many ways is a necessarily different work than <em>Spotlight</em>. But the two films do share one commonality: a fundamental compassion about the fragility at the core of the human condition. With <em>Spotlight</em> you managed to create something that simultaneously honors that fragility and yet never launders the ugly truths at the core of the story. That kind of tightrope walk is a rare pleasure to watch.</p>

    <title>Suffragette</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>In 1913 you quite literally gave your life for the cause; the right for women to vote. You and your sisters-in-arms endured public humiliation, beatings at the hands of police, and brutal stints in prison. Not to mention, you know, the widespread, garden-variety sexism that was the norm in early 20th century Britain. Along with famed suffrage leader Emmeline Pankhurst and others, you espoused confrontational tactics in order to gain attention and support for the cause. You broke windows, blew shit up, and the government branded you terrorists. What you really were was an epic badass and a hero. </p>

<p>So why did you only show up half way through <em>Suffragette</em>?</p>

<p>You’d be pleased to know that the film about a movement you helped foster was written by a woman, and directed by a woman (who worked very hard to make sure the crew behind the camera was populated by a <a href="http://www.fastcocreate.com/3052619/suffragette-director-sarah-gavron-on-fixing-the-gender-imbalance-in-filmmaking">proportionate number of women</a>). But instead of focusing on you or the militant organization behind suffrage, the movie chooses an unlikely hero to be our entry point into the story; a poor, working class mother. </p>

<p>Carey Mulligan plays Maud Watts, a laundry employee fed up with unfair working conditions and her predatory boss. Though reluctant to join the suffrage movement, she soon becomes deeply engaged in the cause, becoming what the local constabulary refer to as an “agitator”. Her humiliated husband kicks her out and forbids her to see her young son, thus making the suffrage movement the only thing in Maud’s life worth fighting for. </p>

<p>If you don’t recognize the name Maud Watts, it’s because she, and some other characters are fictional. Writer Abi Morgan lets us watch Maud grow from an obedient wife and employee, to a radicalized suffragette. Morgan, who also wrote <em>Shame</em> and <em>Iron Lady</em>, is an actor’s writer  - just ask Michael Fassbender, and Meryl Streep (blink and you’ll miss her cameo here as Pankhurst). She leaves a lot of the character off the page and in the hands of Mulligan, who lets Maud emerge with melancholic dignity. Other characters, like Helena Bonham Carter’s rebellious nurse Edith Ellyn, and Maud’s stern husband Sonny, are not given as much dimension. </p>

<p>Real or composite, many of the characters and scenarios feel rote, with the exception of the scenes between Maud and Inspector Arthur Steed, who is tasked with taking down the Women’s Social and Political Union (WSPU). Played with grizzled righteousness by Brendon Gleeson, Steed compares the suffragettes to anarchists and Fenian agitators, and sees them as a threat against the government and the king. Mulligan and Gleeson’s interactions are reminiscent of those between Bobby Sands and Father Dominic in <em>Hunger</em>; rife with tension, steely resolve, and begrudging respect. Sadly these interactions are too few. </p>

<p>Director Sarah Gavron infuses <em>Suffragette</em> with diligent attention to period detail while subtly illustrating the progress of the new century beside the tenuous grasp of the old. Double decker buses share the road with horses and carriages, the WSPU uses telephones and printing presses, Steel’s officers use cameras to secretly to track the suffragette’s movements, all in effort to remind us that this really wasn’t such a long time ago. </p>

<p>Perhaps your character is not given as much screen time because Morgan and Gavron thought the audience would find it easier to root for a woman who has lost everything. <em>Suffragette</em>, unfortunately, isn’t really for me, but for a younger audience of women and men who maybe aren’t so familiar with the early women’s rights movement. This is why at times the film feels like a primer. <a href="http://www.newstatesman.com/politics/feminism/2015/10/what-did-suffragette-movement-britain-really-look">The real suffrage movement</a> was far more fractious and messy – it included women of colour, lesbians, imperialism, elitism, racism, and people and events that don’t necessarily lend themselves to an easy narrative. </p>

<p>The backlash against the movie <em>Suffragette</em> for <a href="http://www.thestranger.com/film/feature/2015/11/04/23117815/why-our-reviewer-refuses-to-write-a-review-of-suffragette">white-washing history</a>, and against the cast for <a href="http://flavorwire.com/541222/meryl-streeps-suffragette-t-shirt-disaster-what-were-they-thinking">being tone-deaf</a>, is unfortunate but not unwarranted. The movie is good, but not good enough to rise above its own prejudices. Your triumphant heroics – and those of Sophia Duleep Singh, Annie Kenney and others - are worthy of their own biopic. If that happens, I’ll be sure to let you know how it turns out.</p>
