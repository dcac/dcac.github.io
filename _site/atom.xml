    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>2015 offered up some pretty high-octane cinema - a man on Mars, a Max gone mad, and galaxies far, far away. But none of these <em>magna opera</em> hold a candle to the quiet, unadorned, explosion-free drama that is my absolute favourite film of 2015. Andrew Haigh’s <em>45 Years</em> commanded all of my attention and emotion, broke my heart, and haunts me months after seeing it. </p>

<p>A week shy of his 45th wedding anniversary, Geoff learns that the remains of his former lover, Katya, have been found, 50 years after she fell to her death during a Swiss hiking holiday. He drifts away to where his wife, Kate, can’t seem to reach him. And with that slight tug, a lifetime of contentment and comfort begins to unravel, exposing the fragile center that arguably lies at the heart of all human bonds, even those we think unbreakable. Especially those. </p>

<p>A huge part of why I love <em>45 Years</em> so much is that it reminds me of Daphne du Maurier’s <em>Rebecca</em>, which is only the most awesome and flawless novel ever written. In it, the memory of the deceased first love poisons the mind of the new wife with questions and doubts. In <em>45 Years</em>, Katya, perfectly preserved in a glacier, frozen in time and in Geoff’s old photographs hidden in the attic, comes to haunt Kate, no longer the new wife, but aged and weathered compared to the ghost of the woman whose place she took. But while Rebecca in du Maurier’s novel is a sinister, overwhelming presence that almost commands more of our attention as the live characters, Katya never really becomes important to the audience. It is Kate to whom our hearts go out, as Geoff withdraws into his memories and residual grief, leaving her to her sadness, jealousy, and disillusionment. As Kate and Geoff, Charlotte Rampling and Tom Courtenay are amazing together, breathtakingly intimate one instant, and suddenly, jarringly, alien to each other the next. The undoing of their relationship is so tough to watch because, at the beginning, they do such a brilliant job of drawing you into their cozy, content little world. </p>

<p>The film has an elegant ‘bare bones’ feel to it, from its simple yet masterful cinematography to the absence of a musical score. Yet, it never feels empty or lacking. Each scene is suffused with an intimacy and energy that belie its slow pace. The neat, static framing of each shot allows the characters to draw together and apart as they struggle to grasp at what was once solid between them and is now startlingly fragile. The lighting plays between obscuration and illumination, the week-long, foggy, greyness giving way to warmth and brightness only towards the end (with no small amount of irony), at Geoff and Kate’s anniversary party, the happy ending that should be but is not to be. </p>

<p><em>45 Years</em> is getting some well-deserved love at the top of awards season, most notably for Charlotte Rampling’s portrayal of Kate. The camera often remains on her face for long stretches, and it’s like she packs three pages of dialogue into the wordless droop of her eyes and the subtle turn at corners of her mouth. Rampling is never less than utterly brilliant, so it almost feels redundant to go on about what a great job she does, but I will say that the real marvel of her performance is that it owns the narrative but also grants you room to move with her and feel as she feels, and you can’t help but wonder, “What would I do if…?” or “How would I feel if…?” Going into the Oscar race for Best Actress, there is only one shot that really needs to be submitted for consideration – the very last one; Kate’s face in close up, placid on the surface, struggling to contain the turmoil just beneath. It is a devastating image, and I was a mess as the credits rolled.  </p>

<p>As much as I love to be entertained and dazzled, I can’t resist the small, out-of-nowhere films that swipe my legs out from under me. While <em>45 Years</em> is a pretty film, and at first seems like a gentle film, it is by no means an easy film. I enjoyed the big blockbusters on most ‘Best of 2015’ lists, but this one broke me in a way none of the post-apocalyptic, outer-space, teeth-rattling fare even came close.</p>

    <title>Mad Max: Fury Road is Obviously the Best Film of 2015</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>These year-end assignments present a bit of a conundrum for me. I have this set of critical ideals in which I try to judge each film I see on its own merits (or lack thereof), and those alone. It’s a bit of a fool’s errand, since I can’t wipe the slate completely clean every time I walk into the theatre. Hell, it sometimes even causes crises of conscience. But when I can lock out all the external noise, <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/1/7/wolf-of-wall-street.html">the work speaks for itself</a>. Of course, that’s also how I can end up <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/4/26/pain-gain.html">kind of liking a Michael Bay film</a>. It’s a system with some distressing outcomes.</p>

<p>Yet, here I am, doing that one thing I try to avoid: judging each film not on its own merit, but on how out holds up against others for the sole reason they were released in the same calendar year. But we humans do like order, and if a particular 12-month span affords us that, we’ll take it. There’s comfort to be found in a world that makes sense.</p>

<p>Which may be the very reason I found <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> so thrilling. It’s a movie that feels like it’s about to come off the rails at any moment. The world George Miller throws us into is bananas. It’s a film that <em>feels</em> out of control. Instead, it’s one of the best examples of filmmaking precision I’ve seen in years.</p>

<p>Unlike <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/1/9/sorry-the-lego-movie-is-the-best-film-of-2014.html">my choice last year</a>, this one’s not based on a personal, emotional reaction, but a purely visceral one. And honestly, it’s refreshing to respond to a film on that pure gut level – to be reminded that the craft of cinema itself, when executed on a master level, is enough in and of itself to excite. </p>

<p>That’s not to say that I find <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> lacking in any other departments. What I thought of it in terms of character, story, and acting, is covered <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/5/20/mad-max-fury-road.html">in my review</a>. This essay is simply about falling in love with cinema again. Lately, my relationship with film has felt more like a marriage that&#39;s gone a bit stale: I love it dearly, but I hadn&#39;t felt that all-consuming infatuation that drew me to it in the first place; the kind that had me returning to the same films over and over, desperate for the heady rush that comes from pure passion.</p>

<p>It’s fortuitous that I saw <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em> before writing this. Though that film didn&#39;t fully work for me, what I did love was watching filmmakers lose themselves in discussing Hitchcock&#39;s total mastery of cinema: his cutting, camera placement, use of actors. It&#39;s that same rapture that keeps bringing me back to <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em>. Miller is so confident in every insane idea, that he overrode the built-in skepticism that has been a key instrument in my film-watching toolkit for years. Actually, it didn&#39;t just override it, it blew it right up. I came out of <em>Mad</em> <em>Max: Fury Road</em> with the fervour of a born-again zealot. I wanted to preach the Gospel of Miller, whether or not anyone wanted to hear it.</p>

<p>Despite my earlier protestations, one of the things I like to do at the end of any year is to try and figure out what has changed for me as a moviegoer. Often that fans into the ever-growing chasm of technological progress: the reemergence of 3D as gimmick, the transition from film to digital projection. 2015, however, was about teaching me that maybe I don’t have to fret so much about consciously placing every movie into its own hermetically-sealed chamber. A great film will do that all on its own, and I won’t even realize it. The irony is that it took a movie possibly surpassed only by <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens</em> preconceived expectations to do that. <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> not only introduces a new actor in its iconic lead role, but it also bares the weight of 30 years of anticipation. And it leaves those expectations in the figurative and literal dust as it races forward, daring us all to keep up. </p>

<p>Or maybe it’s not ironic at all. Maybe it’s perfectly fitting. Miller took my own preconceived ideas—about the <em>Mad Max</em> series and about cinema itself—and turned them on their head, showing me something I didn’t even know I wanted.</p>

<p>And because of that, <em>Mad Max:Fury Road</em> is the best film of 2015.</p>

    <title>Creed is Surprisingly the Best Film of 2015</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Sports films resonate because, by and large, they’re comfortably predictable. They appeal to our basest human needs – to persevere, to win, to feel the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat, as the saying goes. Many of us adults will never experience the life-altering rush of an athletic triumph, but we all face obstacles in our lives that we must find the strength to overcome.</p>

<p>Boxing movies specifically cater to this instinct because they are quite literally about fighting. And though the good ones are about much more than that, at their very essence, boxing movies lay out a blueprint for success: set your goal, test your physical and mental capacities, find something inside of yourself that you didn’t know existed, and push yourself to the limits. Watching that cinematic journey and savouring vicarious victory is one of life’s small pleasures. Call it sophomoric, call it cliché, but you know what? A lot of the time life <em>is</em> fucking cliché. And <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/11/27/creed.html"><em>Creed</em></a> director Ryan Coogler knows that. He embraces these clichés and still manages to exceed expectations. He made the <em>Rocky</em> film a fan would have made. Because he <em>is</em> a fan. </p>

<p>When you’re six or seven you’re not necessarily able to articulate why certain things appeal to you more than others, you simply love the things that you love. Most kids in the late 70s/early 80s were obsessed with the original <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy. I was obsessed with the <em>Rocky</em> movies. An unknown, past-his prime, palooka from Philly defying all odds to go up against Apollo Creed, the heavyweight boxing champion of the world? Those other kids could keep their light sabres and their dark sides, my heart belonged to the Italian Stallion, king of the underdogs</p>

<p>As much as I enjoy a rollicking sci-fi or fantasy flick, even as a kid, I always felt more connected to quiet, character-based movies rooted in reality. And when elements of the <em>Rocky</em> films became formulaic and cheesy, I always found something – a song, a character, a memorable line of dialogue – that kept me hanging on. Being able to look past certain idiosyncrasies, missteps, and outright disaster (<em>Rocky</em> goddamned <em>V</em>), and not walk away is the basis of unconditional love. It’s also the classic definition of an unhealthy, co-dependent relationship. </p>

<p><em>Creed</em> was the chance to make things right again - and not just with me and other die-hard fans who would have been content to let things end with 2006’s better than expected <em>Rocky Balboa</em>. It was an opportunity to reintroduce a set of characters and circumstances for a whole new generation to fall in love with. Even with the winning combo of director Ryan Coogler and actor Michael B. Jordan (lauded for delivering 2013’s critical darling <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/8/6/fruitvale-station.html"><em>Fruitvale Station</em></a>), I honestly didn’t know if <em>Creed</em> could do it. I walked into the theatre with lowered expectations. I walked out a born-again believer. </p>

<p>There was one specific moment when <em>Creed</em> won back my affections. Adonis, Apollo Creed’s illegitimate son, has just moved into Rocky’s house to train with him full time. On a shelf, Adonis sees a picture of Rocky and his son, Robert, taken when Rocky was in his prime, and Robert was a child. Rocky mentions that Robert moved away, that it was difficult for him living in Philly being Rocky’s kid, and that they have a good relationship though they don’t see each other often. </p>

<p>This scene is played matter-of-factly. Coogler doesn’t force Sylvester Stallone or Jordan to mine the emotional depths of the father/son dynamic in a film that is so plainly about the father/son dynamic. But those of us with an encyclopedic knowledge of the <em>Rocky</em> franchise recognized that the picture is of Stallone and his real-life son, Sage, who died in 2012. This scene could have been maudlin, or tacky, or gross, but instead it was something every <em>Rocky</em> film since the first one hasn’t been: powerfully understated. </p>

<p>There’s a truth in <em>Creed</em> that I just wasn’t expecting, and when it showed up in this, and every other scene, I realized how much it had been missing from the other films. After the unlikely runaway success of the first <em>Rocky</em> film in 1976, each subsequent sequel became more interested in putting butts in seats, than in reaching any kind of emotional honesty. Sure, there were scenes that moved me –  Rocky’s monologue when Adrian is in a coma (<em>Rocky II</em>) , Mickey’s death (<em>Rocky III</em>), Rocky’s speech in front of the Politburo (<em>Rocky IV</em>)– but I was always aware that I was being manipulated, either through sweeping soundtrack strings, painfully sentimental dialogue, or yet another training montage. I felt <em>something</em>, but they were cheap jabs, never gut punches.</p>

<p><em>Creed</em> hit me. Hard.</p>

<p>I expected that <em>Creed</em> would focus on family bonds. The title is kind of a giveaway. I knew Adonis’ internal fight would be to accept his father’s legacy. But I wasn’t prepared for Rocky’s fight for his life, and the larger theme of mortality. And I certainly wasn’t prepared to see Stallone deliver the performance of his career. Perhaps because for once, he hadn’t written Rocky’s dialogue, or because this is the first movie in which Rocky doesn’t box, or maybe because his primary job on <em>Creed</em> was as an actor, but it really freed him to explore the character of Rocky as a mere mortal, and not as a legend. When he delivers the line, “Time takes us all down in the end. It’s undefeated,” it’s not done for effect. It’s just the truth. </p>

<p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/6/11/requiem-for-an-underdog.html">If <em>Rocky IV</em> was the movie I didn’t know I needed after my dad died in 1985</a>, then <em>Creed</em> is the movie I didn’t know I needed in 2015, when I became the primary caregiver to my mother who is battling Stage IV metastatic melanoma. Which we found out about on February 11th, 30 years to the day after my dad’s death because yes, life is a fucking cliché, and we all have to fight whether we want to or not. The alternative isn’t an option. </p>

<p>“One step at a time. One punch at a time. One round at a time.” It’s a mantra from <em>Creed</em>, and it may be simplistic and banal, but it reminds me that there’s just as much triumph to be had from helping my mother get up my four porch steps without both of us collapsing from exhaustion, as there is in running up the famous steps of the Philadelphia Museum of Art. And it’s enough to just enjoy an unexpectedly solid film that lets me savour a predictable victory. In life, it’s a gift we’re rarely given. </p>

    <title>Mad Max: Fury Road is Unapologetically the Best Film of 2015</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Someone once recently called me that most derogatory of critical terms—fan boy—because I wrote that I‘d seen <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> <strong>ten</strong> (10) times in the theatre. That’s like accusing someone of being a snob because they go to the Louvre every week. There is just a fundamental misapprehension of the impulse at work.</p>

<p>A fan boy is driven by slavish, unthinking devotion to a piece of culture he sees, sadly, as somehow self-actualizing. Experiencing a flat out piece of art like <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> multiple times is simply a question of good taste being rewarded with each interaction. </p>

<p>George Miller’s ridiculous film is so outside the realm of what’s probable that it smacks of a kind of magic. There really aren’t that many experimental art films that have a price tag of 150 million dollars and feature two pre-eminent actors like Charlize Theron and Tom Hardy. More importantly, there aren’t that many experimental art films that are so fucking entertaining. When I say entertaining, I mean there is a sequence early on that utterly enraptured every audience I experienced the film with. And each time the ten-minute-or-so-sequence ended, <em>each time,</em> there was a collective silence for three beats followed by a slow exhalation—then usually a smattering of things like “Christ almighty” or something similar.</p>

<p>I don’t really care much who wins Oscar, to be honest. The actual value of it seems disproportionate, but I do think that some of the conversations surrounding the ceremony make it completely worthwhile as an exercise. <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> is especially worthy of being a part of that conversation for a lot of reasons, but here is the one I think is most significant. It is completely true to itself as a piece of art. It never contradicts its own logic, never sacrifices story and its narrative integrity, and always treats it characters as three-dimensional—no matter how heightened and outlandish they seem externally. This is a world George Miller <em>believes</em> in and he is possessed of the craft and the talent to bring the audience fully into that world with him. </p>

<p>So much about what’s good art versus what is not, once you get past a kind of qualitative baseline (some things are just so poorly conceived and executed they never pass the starting gate) is about each persons’ willingness to engage with the work on its own terms. That doesn’t mean disengaging with your critical faculties or empty-headed consumption, it just means that whatever your initial preconceptions, you allow the film to confound them—if it can. The real genius of <em>Fury Road</em> is that it takes those preconceptions and burns them with fire from the end a guitar.</p>

<p>So far I’m one for one with my Dear Cast and Crew <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/1/8/seriously-birdman-is-the-best-film-of-2014.html">Best Picture Oscar Predictions™</a>. <em>Birdman</em>—last year’s winner—and <em>Fury Road</em> definitely share some DNA. They are both products of minds possessed of original, daring, boisterous and Loki-like levels of mischief. Each of these films is predicated on a big fuck you to the industry that helped spawn them. In <em>Birdman</em> it is textual and overt (Iñárritu is like that) but <em>Fury Road</em> is a middle finger to convention simply by existing. There is no way to exaggerate how hopeful <em>Fury Road</em> makes me about what is possible when there is a perfect convergence of creator, circumstance, concept and just plain dumb luck.</p>

<p>And if there is anything the Academy falls all over itself to reward, it is a film that holds everything they value in utter contempt. So it is just possible I could go two for two.</p>

    <id>/content/2016/1/12/sicario-is-definitely-the-best-film-of-2015</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>I’ll spare you my usual end-of-year trepidation about <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/8/2/the-to-do-list.html">critical subjectivity</a> and <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/1/6/no-the-trip-to-italy-is-the-best-film-of-2014.html">ethical dilemmas</a> and simply say this: there was only one movie in 2015 that thrilled me to the point of physical response—had me grinning, and clapping my hands, and clenching my fists, and holding my breath. You may be surprised to know that it wasn’t <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> (just like <em>I</em> was surprised that it wasn’t <em>The Force Awakens</em>). </p>

<p>No, the movie that sent me into gleeful paroxysms was, in fact, a gloomy action-thriller about the moral frivolousness of the war on drugs. </p>

<p>I can’t argue that there’s anything terribly original about <em>Sicario</em>. From the structure of its plot to the politics of its themes, it’s basically a mash-up of stuff we’ve seen before. A pretty brilliant mash-up, to be fair—of two classic films, in particular: Steven Soderbergh’s 2000 drug epic <em>Traffic</em>, and the seminal profilers-hunting-serial-killers flick <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>. </p>

<p>What makes it special, then? What is the one thing <em>Sicario</em> did better than any other movie?</p>

<p>Simply put: it was the most masterful display of filmmaking I saw all year. </p>

<p>In a year notable for action-picture self-indulgence (the final act of <em>Jurassic World</em> seemed lifted from the climax of some long ago Wrestlemania, and, for all its virtues, <em>Mad Max: Fury Road</em> is less interested in restraint than it is in making its complete lack of restraint as efficient as possible) <em>Sicario</em> is a tense, exciting film that finds tension and excitement in the smallest, quietest moments. Better than any other film, it uses the unique virtues of the art form to tell a story, provoke thought, stoke emotion, wring sweat, punch guts. </p>

<p>It begins and ends with director Denis Villeneuve. Such care is taken with the way the narrative unfolds that you can’t help but be amazed by how simple he makes it seem. Scene by scene, moment by moment—there’s not a wasted frame, or line of dialogue, or sound effect, or shadow, or mote of dust on the lens. None of it is superfluous, it all contributes to the experience. This attention to detail in the construction of each scene pays incredible dividends. A convoy of trucks passing over the Mexican border makes for perhaps the most tense scene in the entire film—and perhaps in the <em>entire year</em> of film. No chase, no stunts—all they’re doing is <em>driving</em>. For me, that sequence was more viscerally exciting than any of the practical stunts in <em>Fury Road</em>, more anxiety-inducing than watching Matt Damon try to duct-tape his facemask back together in <em>The Martian</em> (I mean, you know he’s going to—there’s still another hour of the movie left). </p>

<p>Later, during an interrogation, a character far in the background leaves the room, and, as he does, subtly flips the switch on a camcorder. Such dread is generated by that small gesture that there is no need to see what happens next, you know it’s going to be terrible. Villeneuve knows this and smartly cuts away. That kind of confidence in a filmmaker exhilarating. </p>

<p>Still later, when a romantic tryst takes an unexpected turn, Villeneuve once again refuses to take the easy route; there’s no big surprise, no attempt to shock—instead we share a drawn-out moment of recognition with the protagonist, an FBI agent played by Emily Blunt, as she notices an object sitting in the foreground. We share her confusion, too, as she tries to process exactly what it means. What could easily have been expressed with a stab of music or a smash cut is instead drawn out over the course of ninety agonizing seconds, and concludes with one of those satisfying movie moments that is not quite unexpected but wonderfully fulfilling when elegantly executed. And this film is nothing if not elegant in its execution. </p>

<p>David Mamet described the essential task of the dramatist as <a href="http://movieline.com/2010/03/23/david-mamets-memo-to-the-writers-of-the-unit/">striking a balance between withholding and vouchsafing information</a>. This isn’t just a principle that Villeneuve exhibits in his filmmaking; it’s also a pretty accurate plot description of <em>Sicario</em>. Blunt is recruited to join a special-ops task force that she knows virtually nothing about, and, over the course of the film, during briefings and missions and personal encounters, learns the real (and disturbing) mandate of the operation. Information is gradually revealed, the story blooms orchid-like. But while I admired the cleverness of the scene construction throughout, it was never from a distance. Villeneuve puts you inside the car, inside the tunnels, inside Blunt’s head as she struggles to put together the puzzle—the same puzzle we are. </p>

<p>Blunt is terrific, by the way, forgoing all the tough-chick posturing that so many actresses might have brought to the role. She speaks plainly, refuses to be intimidated, stands up for her values, shoots bad guys, but never has to act masculine to demonstrate her competence. What is lovely about her character – and what makes her very different than Clarice Starling in <em>The Silence of the Lambs</em>, that other young female law enforcement agent drawn into a cat-and-mouse game between opposing forces of good and evil – is that she very well could have be a man. Her gender is secondary to all the other traits – her honesty, her curiosity, her incorruptibility – that make her the moral center of the film. For the sake of brevity, I’ll withhold praise for her co-stars Del Toro and Brolin, who each deserve seven or eight paragraphs of adulation and flattery, playing tough guys without ever playing tough, chewing just enough scenery to satisfy our appetites, leaving enough behind that they maintain their humanity (Brolin’s character, in particular, could have been played like a cartoon, but isn’t, and watching him walk that precarious line is one of the thousand small thrills of this film).</p>

<p>And if that wasn’t enough. <em>Sicario</em> is also the most beautiful film of the year, which means, yes, of course, that it was shot by Roger Deakins, who shall heretofore be referred to as The Great Roger Deakins, and who has become, for me, one of those contributors whose name in the credits makes a film worth seeing; he is, to date, the only cinematographer whose IMDB page I have visited in desperate anticipation of his next flick (for all my fellow GRDites out there, it’s the Coen Brothers’ <em>Hail Caesar!</em>). </p>

<p>Even the most incompetent Instagram photographer can capture a half-decent sunset, but Deakins manages, late in the film, to shoot a sunset that will make you feel like you’ve never seen a sunset before.</p>

<p>Many of you were disappointed by the third act, and, to be honest, I get where you’re coming from. We spend so much of the film seeing this world through Blunt’s eyes (as Tim McEown nicely explains in <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/10/26/sicario.html">his review</a>) that the sudden shift in perspective is, admittedly, jarring. But it makes such perfect narrative sense that I can’t imagine the film ending any other way: the curtain is finally drawn back, we see the gruesome truth that Blunt has unknowingly been party to, and for that truth to have any real impact we need to see the consequences. Not hear about them in expositional dialogue, not be spared the horror. We have to <em>see</em> it. And nothing in cinema this year will elate your lizard-brain and crush your moral consciousness like that moment. </p>

<p>What I want most from watching a film is to <em>feel</em> it. For it to be an experience. I want to be moved from one place to another during the course of those two precious hours – intellectually, emotionally, even <em>physically</em> – and film, as a medium, is able to compel this movement in some very special ways.</p>

<p><em>Sicario</em> moved me, and that’s why, for me, it was the best film of the year.</p>

    <id>/content/2016/1/11/inside-out-is-easily-the-best-film-of-2015</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Most of the time, we film critics are guided by four key emotions: anger (how does <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/8/16/dream-house.html">this shit</a> get made?), disgust (who is <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/4/30/we-need-to-talk-about-adam.html">this shit</a> made for?), fear (will they ever stop making <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/2/15/a-good-day-to-die-hard.html">this shit</a>?), and sadness (why did <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/12/15/the-phantom-menace.html">this have to be so shitty</a>?) . But once in a while, a film comes along that evokes pure joy (no, not <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/1/4/joy.html"><em>Joy</em></a>). It cuts through all cynicism, speaks volumes about the human condition, and is nothing but a delight for the senses.  </p>

<p>Without exception, this year, that film for me was <em>Inside Out</em>.</p>

<p>A little voice inside my head told me <em>Inside Out</em> was going to be the best film of the year the minute I walked out of the theatre. Five voices, actually – representing each of my different critical faculties: aesthetics, story, technique, creativity, and me. Yes, the “me” factor is the hardest element to please, because it’s an impossible to define genome that can illogically override all others, yet won’t magically appear just because the other four factors are satisfied. “Me” is built from the unique islands of personality that make up who I am – an emotional being, first, and a film critic, second. Luckily, in this case, I don’t have to separate the two.</p>

<p>At a base level, the animation is eye-popping and beautiful, the voice casting is pitch-perfect, the premise is wildly original (even if the formula is familiar), and the final execution is altogether inspired. For starters, I laughed a lot. From the simple physical humour in the Abstract Thought sequence, to the entire treatment of Dream Productions, every new corner of the mind was a pure delight to explore. Even throw-away jokes, like when Joy knocks over two boxes on the Train of Thought and can’t separate the “facts” and “opinions” (“Ah don’t worry, happens all the time!”), left me laughing and utterly in love with the movie – and the minds behind it.</p>

<p>I also cried more than I care to say. When Goofball Island crumbles into the abyss, it’s more than just a cartoon plot point. That shit is <em>real</em>. We do grow up, we do change, and sometimes we do lose a part of ourselves. Even Bing Bong, rendered primarily as a childish goof, makes a final sacrifice that is deeply meaningful and boldly symbolic. I never had an imaginary friend – at least not one that I remember (hmm…) – but it doesn’t matter. The experience of growing up and sorting through complex emotions is universal. The boldness of the filmmakers to explore how “core” memories shape our identity and, most impressively, how those memories take on a different meaning over time, is remarkable. It takes us all decades to fully learn and appreciate that insight. And yet it’s packaged in one of the most delightful films I’ve seen in years. So what if it’s through Happy Meals? </p>

<p><em>Inside Out</em> is not just “good for a kid’s film”. I don’t even think it <em>is</em> a kid’s film. I can’t imagine how anyone pre-pubescent can begin to grapple with the emotional depth and intellectual sophistication that the narrative presents. The film is<em>literally</em> about learning how to live with sadness. They’ve made the metaphor the actual story, and made being meta more than about being ironic or referential. Nothing else this year even comes close to matching that level of narrative ambition.</p>

<p>Normally, when people say an animated film will also appeal to adults, they mean one of two things: it leans heavily on pop culture references, or it’s got some naughty innuendo. Rarely do they mean that it will send you into a puddle of tears, roar with laughter, and marvel at its brilliance. </p>

<p>But marvel I did. The film spoke to a lot more than my personal quirks and experiences (though the hockey angle and moving to a new town at a tender age didn’t hurt). And yes, the fact I had a daughter this year played no small part in why the coming-of-age tale of an 11-year-old-girl was so touching for me. But I simply couldn’t shake how profoundly they made simple ideas. Or how easily they transported us into complex situations. The film is, in a word, remarkable. </p>

<p>In any other hands, <em>Inside Out</em> could have been a poorly executed moral lesson or weak foray into pop psychology. Instead, it’s the best film of 2015. </p>

    <title>The Revenant</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>You are the yin to Quentin Tarantino’s despicable yang. If you ever met and shook hands I fear that the resulting implosion of egos would envelope the universe. Your film, <em>The Revenant</em>—a period piece set in the American frontier of the early 1800’s—shares enormous similarities, at least in broadly thematic terms, with Tarantino’s <em>The Hateful Eight.</em></p>

<p>These are visually ambitious, violent, sausage-fests filled with men going about the business of bringing death and destruction to themselves and others in settings that underpin how little our ambitions mean. Each depends upon the harshness of the environment to prop up their central conceits. In the <em>Hateful Eight,</em> it is used to facilitate a kind of locked room mystery that leans suspiciously towards the kind of paranoid tension that infuses John Carpenters <em>The Thing</em>. In <em>The Revenant</em> the wintry frontier is where men find their limits and are tested as moral creatures. It is a crucible that sorts the wheat from the chaff. The relentless, unforgiving weather is also an essential backdrop that parallels the kind of men that it attracts—ruthless, volatile and often fundamentally amoral.</p>

<p>Women are only present as uni-dimensional props. This is more to do with the period and location than anything else but it is not a coincidence that each of you specifically chose these settings. Both films, as well, are similarly possessed of a kind of blunt-edged philosophical bent—that more often than risks being overshadowed by the bombast of elevated performances and stunning visual flourishes.</p>

<p>The difference is that the <em>The Revenant</em>’s philosophical underpinnings, while crude, are fully realized, whereas the best than can be said about <em>The Hateful Eight</em> is that the 70mm print <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/1/4/the-hateful-eight.html">sure looks nice</a>. Still, <em>The Revenant</em> is a flawed film, with a central problem it never manages to solve. Even as you successfully express the films straightforward thesis about the hollowness of our collective ambitions and desires, (especially in an environment that often annihilates us with an indifference that is literally chilling) the narrative never manages to really connect this to characters that feel fully realized. As engaging as they are, their motivations remain opaque and often seem fleeting—more contrivance than real.</p>

<p>With performances that are often memorable and idiosyncratic—Domhnall Gleeson and Tom Hardy are rapidly becoming two of the best English language actors around—there is still something untethered about them. The film never manages to connect all its various moving parts, despite DiCaprio’s strong lead and an interesting cast. Part of this is a problem of tone; too often the film meanders narratively when it should be as lean as its characters. However, that can and is often saved by the incredible sweep of the visuals, and the strength of the various interludes of violence and the incredible kineticism of Emmanuel Lubezki’s camera. </p>

<p>The fundamental difficulty, though, is withyour intent. While it is clear what the film expresses, it is not at all clear as to why that expression is worth the work the audience and the characters have to do. A more significant connection needs to be made between why these truths that bang up against one another—individual ambition and desire versus the disinterest of nature—are worthwhile subjects of yet another film. This is, after all, well trodden ground, with any number of films having explored it to greater or lesser degrees of success: <em>Jeremiah Johnson</em>, <em>Little Big Man</em>, <em>The Last Of The Mohicans</em> all have mined this territory extensively.</p>

<p>Still, just as a filmmaking venture bereft of any particular subtext, this is an incredible piece of work. It is head and shoulders above most films I have seen this year, in purely cinematic terms, and will likely win a lot of praise. It is worth seeing as entertainment, even if it falls short as a fully realized work of art.</p>

<p>Despite being a far better filmmaker, at least in terms of scope and originality and perhaps also artistically, you seem to be held to a different critical standard than Tarantino. Whereas you are derided for arrogance or self-regard and lofty, if simplistic, philosophical ambitions, Tarantino seems to be lauded for an ego than perhaps eclipses yours and a philosophical disposition that can be most charitably described as sophomoric. But that is an argument best had elsewhere. </p>

    <id>/content/2016/1/11/score-wars-john-williams-strikes-back</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>It&#39;s not often that a film score is as eagerly anticipated as your score for <em>Star Wars: The Force Awakens.</em> And rarer still that the anticipation isn’t <em>just</em> coming from film music aficionados. The Star Wars film franchise is one of those rare cultural products where even casual fans have a fairly nuanced understanding of its accompanying music, so to say that your work on this project will be under a microscope is a bit of an understatement.</p>

<p>With your return to the franchise that made you a household name, many people, myself included, were anxious to see what you might add to the pantheon of Star Wars themes. Would there be something as instantly iconic as the <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_D0ZQPqeJkk">“Main Title”</a>? Something as powerful as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LxDm-4Jrg9w">“Binary Sunset”</a> (also known as “The Force Theme”)? Or even something as epochal as <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-bzWSJG93P8">“The Imperial March”</a>? Never mind the equally fantastic music of the prequel trilogy, which, with epics like <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qzVBqBosf5w">“Duel of the Fates,”</a> were three masterpiece scores desperately in need of three better movies to go along with them.</p>

<p>Star Wars has always been your comfort zone, your sweet spot. So when I came out of the theatre after seeing <em>The Force Awakens</em> not being able to remember...well, <em>anything</em> of the brilliance I’d just heard, it was admittedly a little confusing. 
But was I going to stop there?</p>

<p>Of course not. You&#39;re the one composer whose legions of fans are going are going to go home and listen to the soundtrack as many times as it takes to unwrap what you just did. And they are not going to stop until they&#39;re humming something new. You&#39;ve earned that trust, especially among Star Wars fans. So even though nothing stuck with me after my initial viewing, I listened until something did. </p>

<p>After giving the score a second listen, it started to make sense why there weren’t any of those catchy themes that were replete throughout the previous trilogies. The music in <em>Force Awakens</em> is incredibly unpredictable. For instance, your <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ueqKtype7Kk">“March of the Resistance”</a>is probably the most recognizable theme in the film, but it&#39;s highly resistant to short-term memory; the melody tumbles here and there, dips this way and that way—and just when you think you know where it&#39;s going, it veers off in the opposite direction. It&#39;s a testament to your mastery of musical form that you weren’t drawn into the predictable patterns that many composers find comfort in. Your refusal to write predictably is apparent throughout the score, and while this unpredictability perhaps earns deductions in the memorability department, it aces every other category with ease. 
“March of the Resistance” also shows a more nuanced approach to thematic writing. It would have been incredibly easy to go with a standard, all-major-all-the-time heroic theme (like your theme for 1978&#39;s <em>Superman</em>). The Resistance are the heroes, after all. But I was happy to see a less black-and-white interpretation in this piece, as the sudden chromaticisms give it a shade of darkness and ambiguity. It&#39;s an interesting take in a world where the themes have been, well, <em>on-the-nose</em> (regardless of how utterly brilliant they are). “The Imperial March” is fantastic, of course, but you have to think that <em>if</em> Darth Vader had commissioned a march for his stormtroopers, his feedback might have been along the lines of, “Uh, it’s great, John—but it sounds a kind of <em>evil</em>.” 
Speaking of evil, Kylo Ren&#39;s musical signature makes numerous appearances throughout the score, and musically it is likely what you would have expected. Menacing horns, swirling strings, and machine-gun trumpet stabs give it a slight resemblance to “The Imperial March”, but it&#39;s more of a leitmotif than a fully-fleshed out thematic piece (Kylo&#39;s Ren&#39;s theme can be heard at 4:20 of the opening track <a href="https://youtu.be/y8ac1Qg-r-8?t=256">“Main Title and Attack on Jakku Village”</a>). And while the first episode of the new trilogy leaves the villain without a fully-formed thematic piece, <em>A New Hope</em> actually did the same. Interestingly enough, “The Imperial March” was only written three years later for <em>The Empire Strikes Back.</em> While the current theme, like Vader&#39;s, is transparently ominous and evil, it works perfectly for Ren: he&#39;s so desperate to fill the enormous shoes of his grandfather that every part of his appearance is calculated to make him look bigger and more threatening than he actually is. If <em>he</em> had commissioned you for a theme, the only question would have been whether what you had written was evil <em>enough</em>. </p>

<p>Listening track-by-track to <em>The Force Awakens</em> is incredibly rewarding, as the writing itself is second to none. It may not be a treasure trove of new thematic gems, but it&#39;s still you at the top of your game. Despite some of your recent scores sounding somewhat dated by contemporary standards (2002&#39;s  <em>Minority Report</em> is like taking a musical time machine to 1983, and <em>War Horse</em> to 1995), the Star Wars sound is timeless. And it&#39;s good to have you back.</p>

<p>But if there&#39;s one criticism I have, it&#39;s how you handled the film’s other most recognizable musical piece: <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=65As1V0vQDM">“Rey&#39;s Theme”</a>. While “March of the Resistance” demonstrates your nuance and restraint, with “Rey&#39;s Theme” you pull an age-old film scoring move by giving the pretty young heroine the pretty little instruments: a bouncy flute here, a twinkly celeste there. But she&#39;s not a dainty little girl – she&#39;s a feisty, mind-controlling, lightsaber-wielding, scavenger-engineer-fighter-pilot jedi-in-the-making – and while this impressive resume is assembled over two hours and sixteen minutes, she&#39;s a badass from her very first scene. It may be a long, long time ago in a galaxy far away, but she&#39;s a modern woman. J.J. Abrams and company manage to make that abundantly clear, whether it&#39;s with her refusal to be led by the hand or her knowing just as much about spacefaring circuitry as perennial man&#39;s man Han Solo, so I can&#39;t help but think that your choice of instruments for Rey is missing the point a little.</p>

<p>That being said, the rest of the score more than makes up for that misstep. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cUBUlKgsNK8">“The Jedi Steps and Finale”</a> is a thrilling journey through themes both new and old alike, and ends the film with a hype-inducing punch. So while your score may leave moviegoers without something new to hum as they exit the cinemas, it&#39;s still easily one of the best scores of the year. </p>

<p><strong>Sincerely,</strong></p>

    <id>/content/2016/1/8/hitchcock-truffaut</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>About a third of the way through your documentary <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em>, the point is made that one of cinema’s strengths is its ability to both slow down and speed up time whenever it fits the filmmaker’s needs. And watching your own film, it struck me that speeding things up is also what you’ve done in this examination of François Truffaut’s seminal study of the works of Alfred Hitchcock. <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em>, the film, condenses Truffaut’s book-length interview into a brief (80 minute) overview of the book itself and what it means to its admirers.</p>

<p>Obviously the book’s central conceit – critic-turned-director Truffaut interviewing Alfred Hitchcock in detail about each of his films – clearly spoke to you. And for obvious reasons. As a film critic and essayist, the kind of detailed analysis therein must have been a kind of movie-nerd Nirvana for you, as well as a kind of call to arms. As explained in your film, the book <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em> was the publication that finally put Hitchcock’s films on the critical map as Important Works. Before that, his films were seen as popular, well-executed genre pieces, which left them removed from the realm of serious critical discourse. Truffaut&#39;s book changed that—not only for Hitchcock, but for film in general. Great art could be found anywhere, even coming out of Hollywood’s factory-like studios.</p>

<p>When it comes to critical examination, you, like Truffaut, subscribe to the <em>auteur</em> theory, which sees the director as the guiding force behind every aspect of a film. And to back that theory up, you’ve assembled a wide-ranging collection of directors to speak on how the book <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em> influenced their understandings of cinema as an art form. Watching Martin Scorsese, David Fincher, Wes Anderson, Kiyoshi Kurosawa, Richard Linklater, and a host of others wax nostalgic on their first experiences with Truffaut’s book offers terrific insight into their development as artists. In hindsight, it seems obvious that this is where Fincher learned his laser-focused scene construction, or where Anderson’s love of image composition was born. In a way, their relationship to the book provides some of the same insight that Truffaut’s book does. The simple act of expressing their love for it is a form of (self-)critical analysis.  </p>

<p>But it may be that your deference towards directors, not just Truffaut and Hitchcock, gets the better of you in the end. Although <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em>’s first half crosscuts between both directors equally, placing them in their own historical and cultural landscapes, the film gradually pushes Truffaut into the background. Instead, <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em> starts to seem more like <em>Hitchcock/Scorsese/Fincher/Anderson/Linklater/Kurosawa</em> etc. Hitchcock’s style and technique becomes the focal point, with barely a mention of Truffaut. </p>

<p>I realize this may have been on purpose. Perhaps the strategy was to shift the focus from interviewer to his subject, as Truffaut does in his own book. But as narrator Bob Balaban describes the later careers of both artists, wrapping the film up, I realized that the <em>Hitchcock/Truffaut</em> had become less about the book itself – it’s place in history, its influence on others – and more about Hitchcock’s importance as a filmmaker. </p>

<p>Simply put, it ends up trying to do a job Truffaut’s book already completed almost 50 years ago.</p>

    <id>/content/2016/1/5/in-the-heart-of-the-sea</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>There’s something about the sea that invites meditation and personal reflection. The undulating ripples, soothing repetition, brilliant blues. But that same sea can be terrifying. Crushing waves, a deafening roar, inky depths that have welcomed countless men down to sleep in Davy Jones Locker. This dichotomy is why seafaring adventures have captured our imagination for centuries. From <em>Rime of the Ancient Mariner</em> to <em>The Perfect Storm,</em> audiences know: when something goes wrong at sea, it often goes horribly wrong. </p>

<p>The same can be said of big-budget films. </p>

<p>No matter how many times you’re tasked with painting an ocean backdrop, I imagine each one is different. It takes a skilled hand to navigate such waters. Too light and it might come across as childish and shallow, too heavy and the result is murky, ugly, swamp-like. <em>In the Heart of the Sea</em> sails into both territories but never manages to find an even keel. Ron Howard has made a rollicking, effects-heavy sea adventure. He has also made a morality tale about class warfare and the hubris of resource depletion. And he has <em>also</em> made a relentlessly dark and mournful film about survival against the odds and the triumph of the human spirit. </p>

<p>Unfortunately they’re all the same film. </p>

<p><em>In the Heart of the Sea</em> is an adaptation of the book that claims to be the true story upon which the American opus _Moby Dick is based. In 1820, a Nantucket whaling ship, The Essex, was destroyed by a sperm whale in the Pacific. Many of the crew lost their lives, and for the few who survived, the true story of what transpired on the ship remained a closely guarded secret. In 1850, Tom Nickerson, the last living survivor of the shipwreck, is visited by the writer Herman Melville, who pays him to tell him the story of what really happened on The Essex when he was just a boy of fourteen. The film flashes back to 1820 when experienced whaler Owen Chase, expecting to be made the captain of The Essex, is usurped by George Pollard, the son of a wealthy ship-builder. The conflict between the beloved and skilled Chase, and the cold and inexperienced Pollard threatens the entire expedition.</p>

<p>Any painter understands the importance of light and how to use it—in reflection, in shadow, in perspective. Howard, too, uses every opportunity to illustrate just how crucial whale oil was to lighting 18th Century America, and in doing so sets the visual tone for the film. In Nantucket, everything looks like an Old Master’s oil painting. From the slick cobblestoned streets, to the sunlight that streams through leaded glass windows. But there is grotesquerie here, too. In one particularly disgusting scene on The Essex, young Tom is dropped into a dead whale’s blowhole to retrieve the last of the oil, his lantern exposing the dripping, fatty innards of the beast’s head. Whaling is ugly business, but without it, Pollard reminds us, “The world would be plunged into darkness.”</p>

<p>It’s on the ocean where your work – and the film – visually come alive. Your paintings and the digital 3D elements complement each other beautifully, and we are treated to an abundant world above and below the water. Scenes of men harpooning a whale and being dragged along behind it, and of a particularly nasty storm, really showcase the harmony between your work and the CGI elements. And when we finally see the Great White Whale, the spectacle is quite literally breathtaking. It’s a shame, though, that the tone of the film gets lost at sea.</p>

<p><em>In the Heart of the Sea</em>’s overlapping themes and one-dimensional characters feel conspicuously flimsy, especially against the film’s vivid realism and attention to graphic detail. The relentless formality of the dialogue, with its, “ahoys”, and “hoist the sails, Master Joy!” may be period appropriate but it feels like it was cribbed from an Errol Flynn swashbuckler. As the story plunges into grimmer territory, it is difficult to conjure up the pathos necessary to follow these characters on their somber journey since we’ve only ever been given sketches of who they are and what they stand for.</p>

<p>The golden rule of screenwriting is “show, don’t tell”, and, in this case, what we are shown far eclipses what we are told. It’s a pity. On the page, this story is thrilling and intense. On the screen, <em>In the Heart of the Sea</em> is hopelessly adrift.</p>
