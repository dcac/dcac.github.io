    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>All you had say was: “No, George.”</p>

<p>That is one of the prerogatives of being a co-writer—you can just say no. Because those fucking Ewoks are the first step on a slippery slope that leads to—well, you know who.</p>

<p>Somewhere in the midst of writing <em>Return Of The Jedi,</em> your collaborator lost contact with what made the first two Star Wars movies more than the sum of their individual parts. As his writing partner you had an opportunity to halt this particular cancer—before it metastasized. If you had just reminded him of the works in which he found his initial inspiration—Kurosawa’s <em>Hidden Fortress</em>, John Ford westerns, the 30’s <em>Flash Gordon serials, _Metropolis</em>, the Harryhausen <em>Sinbad</em> films—he may have seen the error of his ways. Because, while all of these films share a basic earnestness and an often fantastical tone, they were never created specifically for children. </p>

<p>Certainly children could (and did) enjoy all of the various Star Wars properties, but they enjoyed them in the same way that they would have enjoyed Edgar Rice Burroughs or Greek Myths. On one level, they were simple adventure stories: populated by monsters and heroes and whatever subtext existed could be happily ignored. But trying to square the circle of films that feature planet destroying technology <em>and</em> a cloying, rabbit-eared buffoon requires a defter pen than the one your partner wielded—and that really was where you should have stepped in, Lawrence.</p>

<p>When <em>Return Of The Jedi</em> was released in 1983, I had just turned 21—yet it was still clear to me that something had gone astray. It wasn’t difficult to pin down the exact moment, either. </p>

<p>When Leia first encounters the Ewoks about halfway through ROTJ, the unsettling cuteness that had just marginally tainted the first two films—from Jawas to Yoda to R2-D2—really kicked in. Up to that point, <em>Return Of The Jedi</em> had managed to maintain a goofy weekly serial vibe with bits like the stop motion <strong>Rancor</strong> and Jabba getting hoisted on his own petard by Slave Leia™. These beats were perfectly consistent with the tenor of the first two films. But then you and your co-writer began to construct a Frankenstein’s monster—grafting a one-note tribe of children’s discarded plushies onto a relatively complex space opera. It was as if, in a coke-fuelled haze of the likes of which defined American filmmaking in the late seventies, one of your buddies (maybe Francis Ford or Mr. Schrader) dared you to find a place to insert a rag-tag band of cannibal teddy bears into this magnum opus.</p>

<p>Wait. No. That makes Ewoks sound waaaaay more interesting than they are. The truth is they are more like a nicotine stained Chihuahua. Kind of cute from a distance but annoying as hell when you spend more than half a minute in their presence.</p>

<p>The problem with the second half of <em>Return Of The Jedi</em>, which is the same problem that plagues the films that came after, is that they lost the thread; they occupied a tonal space that was completely at odds with the original concept. Neither beast nor fowl, the two different approaches never coalesced. Instead, this fundamental discordance infected what came afterwards—to the extent that, in trying to reconcile the completely irreconcilable halves, they collapsed into an orgy of mismatched pairings: Senate trade deliberations attended by Bugs Bunny with a speech impediment;  a tow-headed Ani growing up into a monster that slaughters a roomful of small children.</p>

<p>All I can really say Lawrence is that I wish you had bullied your pal a little bit and made him <em>pick a fucking lane</em>. Then maybe all the pointless vitriol and hand wringing of the last decade could have been avoided.</p>

<p>I’ve always thought that the cultural significance of the Star Wars films is more deep and meaningful than the actual films themselves. The world they hint at is fascinating but it sort of feels like a tour of Rome with a really shitty guide: you can see the coliseum off in the distance, but you never get to see it close up, to feel the age of the marble, to smell the blood baked into the ancient sand. And the Ewoks and everything they presaged feels like being herded into a junk shop filled with keychain tchotchke versions of the real buildings you’ll never get to experience.</p>

<p>Still. I’m really stoked about December 17<sup>th</sup> .</p>

    <id>/content/2015/12/13/the-empire-strikes-back</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>I’ve wanted to write some version of this letter for a long time.</p>

<p>This is probably not the most original insight, but I’ve long maintained that the stature of the entire Star Wars saga is due mainly to the halo effect caused by <em>The Empire Strikes Back.</em> I’m not casting aspersions on all of the other films – <em><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/12/12/star-wars.html">Star Wars</a></em>, specifically, is of course its own, different kind of masterpiece – but, let’s be honest: ever since <em>Empire</em>, the <em>Star Wars</em> movies have been a study in diminishing returns. And that downward trend coincides with one obvious event: the end of your involvement as producer.</p>

<p>As you know, much of the producer’s job is to say no. Whether it’s budget, schedule, or the worst tendencies of a filmmaker, a good producer keeps a holistic view of a project and reigns in anything that threatens the original vision. If necessity is the mother of invention, then it could be argued that a producer’s duty is to sometimes force necessity—to create boundaries that force creative decisions.</p>

<p>But I’m not writing this letter to bitch about what happened after George Lucas surrounded himself with spineless yes-men. I’m writing to praise <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em>, a film I can comfortably say is nearly <em>perfect</em>.</p>

<p><em>Empire</em> is that rare occurrence that results from every decision being right. So let’s talk a few of them out.</p>

<p>First of all, this film <em>moves</em>. It benefits from the heavy (if seemingly effortless) lifting that <em>Star Wars</em> did in establishing the universe. With the world-building and character introductions out of the way, <em>Empire</em> hits the ground running at a full sprint and never lets up. As a precursor of things to come, about a minute after we catch up with Luke, he gets his face smashed in and is dragged off to a cave (of course, this was also a necessary event, to explain the scars Mark Hamill received from a car accident between films). The intended message comes through loud and clear: no one is safe. We’re in darker territory than <em>Star Wars.</em> </p>

<p>This is made even more clear by the decision to reverse the plot structure of <em>Star Wars</em>, placing the big, show-stopping battle in the first act instead of the third. This establishes the fact that <em>Empire</em> is essentially an extended chase sequence, with not a lot of time to slow down for long expository exchanges. Thank god.</p>

<p>The go-for-broke narrative works its way into the performances as well. Leigh Brackett and Lawrence Kasdan amp up the exchanges, particularly between Han Solo and Princess Leia, giving them a classic Hollywood screwball comedy zing (not surprising, considering Brackett’s <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0102824/">bona fides</a>). Re-watching Harrison Ford and Carrie Fisher exchange insults, I could imagine director Irvin Kershner using <em>His Girl Friday</em> as a reference point for his actors: talk as fast as you can, and force the audience to try and keep up. There’s no hand-holding here—we don’t need it anymore (strangely, this approach was jettisoned for <em>Return of the Jedi</em>, whose first 30 minutes is nothing <em>but</em> a series of character reintroductions.)</p>

<p>Speaking of Kershner, I’m not sure how involved you were in selecting him as director, Gary, but it was a very smart move. <em>Empire</em> is the most well-directed of all six <em>Star Wars</em> films—by a country mile. But it’s not his visual flair that wins the day (even though <em>Empire</em> is also the best-looking film of the series), it’s his focus on the basics: performance and character. As an outsider to this cinematic universe, Kershner was able to hone-in on what he knew how to do best, which was to push out all the superfluous crap that traditionally clogs up storytelling (c.f. <em>The Phantom Menace</em>).  </p>

<p>This kind of laser-sharp attention is what makes Yoda work as the heart and soul of the film.  <em>Empire</em> has its share of action centerpieces (the extended lightsaber duel between Luke and Vader has never been topped in emotional intensity) and mind-blowing plot twists (yes, <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/12/10/how-to-avoid-the-star-wars-syndrome.html"><em>that</em></a> one), but Yoda is what gives the film its depth. I can only guess at your reaction when you saw that the emotional heft of your production was going to rest on the performance of a 3-foot tall muppet, but whatever reluctance (or sheer terror) you may have felt was for naught. And your faith in Kershner was rewarded, as he treated Yoda the only way he knew how: as an actual character. This might sound obvious, but Yoda’s subsequent appearances have proven that the presence of muppeteer Frank Oz is not enough to make him work onscreen. Again, it comes down to decisions – character and performance – and they were perfect.</p>

<p>I could go on – the ingenious cliffhanger with Han Solo, edited to look like a possible last-minute rescue; the way you showed just enough of Darth Vader to prove there’s a human inside the armour – but I’m going to leave you with a simple thanks. </p>

<p>Thank you for helping assemble – and then <em>trusting</em> – the production team to make their own decisions. Thank you for having the faith in the audience’s ability to keep up. But most importantly, thank you for having the backbone to keep George Lucas disciplined. Because no one has since, and that’s why <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> is the only perfect <em>Star Wars</em> film.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Before I’d ever even seen <em>Star Wars</em> (which I begrudgingly admit was less than 48 hours ago), your character was my entry point into the story. As the only little girl in my neighbourhood, when the boys wanted to play <em>Star Wars</em>, I always had to be Princess Leia. I wasn’t a fan of dolls, or dresses, or princesses. Princesses sit around in castles looking pretty, waiting for princes. I wanted to be the <em>Bionic Woman</em>. But when the boys told me Princess Leia was smart, and she gets to shoot a gun, fight bad guys <em>and</em> tell Han Solo off, it seemed like a gig I was born for.</p>

<p>I have a feeling you know what I’m talking about.</p>

<p>Coming to the <em>Star Wars</em> universe at this very late date has had its disadvantages. Even though I’ve only seen the first film in the series, I’m all-too-aware of the plot, the characters, the relationships, and the minutiae. The franchise’s popularity is just too ubiquitous <em>not</em> to. When I sat down to watch <em>Episode IV</em> for the very first time the other night, I knew I would struggle to maintain objectivity. So I imagined myself as a kid in the Seventies (which I was), seeing <em>Star Wars</em> for the first time. What would I have laughed at? What would I have found exciting, or scary, or confusing? Would I have understood the stakes? The relationships? The very concept of The Force? Who would I consider the hero of the story? </p>

<p>Here’s how my kid-brain would have broken it down: Droids and Wookies = funny, Darth Vader = bad, Obi Wan = pretty much Santa with a light saber, Luke = kind of goofy, Han Solo = kind of a dick, Storm Troopers = useless,  Cantina Bar =  cool, The Force = …uh, I’m still not really sure what the Force is. But then there’s Princess Leia, and Princess Leia = <em>awesome!</em> Seriously. Right from the get-go she insults Darth Vader, she cleverly plans her own rescue by hiding a message in R2D2, she gets tortured but doesn’t give anything up, and when she gets out she chides her rescuers for sucking at rescuing her. Then, when they’re stuck in the trash compactor, she figures out how to brace it open, and when her planet gets destroyed she keeps calm and carries on, shoots tons of bad guys, and, yes, she tells Han Solo off. A lot. She’s in control, she’s a rebel, and she’s got attitude. </p>

<p>Obviously, she’s the hero. </p>

<p>To be honest, over the last several decades, I never really felt I was missing out by not seeing the <em>Star Wars</em> movies. I appreciate their pop-cultural significance, I respect the ingenuity that went into them, and I understand why they are so beloved by so, so many. I love great sci-fi, and action movies, too, and I now know why this one is considered to be the ultimate. It was fun, and thrilling and I really did feel like a kid watching it; I managed to experience the excitement, suspense, and camaraderie of joining this ragtag group of misfits as they tried to take down a ruthless dictator intent on world domination. </p>

<p>As far as stories go, however, these aren’t necessarily the ones that grab me by the gut. I’ve always been more intrigued by reality—in seeing the good and evil of regular people played out in all its awkward, hilarious, pathetic wretchedness.
I have a feeling you know what I’m talking about.</p>

<p>Viewing this movie for the first time as an adult means that it comes with a little bit of backstory. Through your hilariously frank autobiographies <em>Postcards</em> <em>From</em> <em>the Edge,</em> and <em>Wishful Drinking</em>, I know about your upbringing, your bipolar disorder, your drug addiction, relationships, and unease with your <em>Star Wars</em> related-fame. As much as I tried to watch <em>A New Hope</em> through a kid’s eyes, I couldn’t separate what I know about you, the person, with what I saw in your portrayal of Leia. And maybe that’s why I loved you so much in this role. </p>

<p>You were 19 years-old when you made this movie, with many of your life’s biggest obstacles and triumphs still ahead of you. And yet you were able to give Leia a sophistication, determination, and playful cynicism that was well beyond your years. It’s a role that, for better or for worse, has defined your career, and it’s impossible to imagine anyone else coming even close. </p>

<p>I do plan on watching <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> and <em>Return of the Jedi</em> (in their unadulterated, pre-’97, VHS versions, by decree of C. Redmond,  C. Tourangeau, and J. Young), mainly because I want to see what else you bring to Leia. I may even watch the rest of the series, if only so I can get to see you play Leia in <em>The Force Awakens</em> with some context. Or instead I may just continue to follow your brilliant, <a href="http://time.com/4137685/carrie-fisher-star-wars-the-force-awakens-good-morning-america-interview/">DGAF publicity</a> for the movie. </p>

<p>Either way, it’s obvious to me that you’re still the hero.</p>

    <id>/content/2015/12/11/youth</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p><em>Youth</em> is a film that is difficult to assess, at least in conventional terms. It remains resolutely surreal throughout the whole of its run time. Your affinity for Fellini-esque discursion makes it difficult to discuss your intentions in concrete terms. What I can say with some certainty is that it provoked a strong emotional reaction, although it’s a little difficult to identify exactly what those emotions are. Regret perhaps. Certainly sadness, a little bit of hope, and a truckload of melancholy.</p>

<p>More than anything else <em>Youth</em> explores what happens when an artist is forced to come to terms with the inexorable passage of time—and whether that necessarily means a diminishment in their capacity to create and see the world in ways that are vital and interesting. </p>

<p>Michael Caine—whose character the film revolves around—plays an emotionally remote, recently retired symphony conductor. He shares a couple of what should be idyllic weeks at a Swiss spa with Harvey Keitel—an octogenarian director. There are several other unique personalities in residence, including Paul Dano and Rachel Weiz. The cast is, with a couple of exceptions, interesting and eclectic—especially Jane Fonda in a harrowingly accurate portrayal of what happens to aging women when shaped by the exigencies of Hollywood.</p>

<p>More a series of loosely connected vignettes than anything else, <em>Youth</em> depends upon a consistency in tone, rather than narrative cohesion, to maintain contact with its characters. The film maintains a delicate tension between hope and regret throughout—a constant push and pull between the idea of a life utterly wasted and the ephemeral rewards a creative existence sometimes allows. Michael Caine in particular seems to view his past with an ambiguity that belies his apparent success, whereas Keitel plays an eighty-year-old man who still (seemingly) remains completely passionate about his vocation. </p>

<p>The rest of the film explores some of the more absurd obsessions that creative people suffer from: relentless self regard, a kind of fetishizing of beauty that is adolescent and unpleasantly instrumental, and crippling self doubt. This all dovetails with a couple of mundane, and brutally honest, moments that pull the characters back into a less esoteric version of reality.</p>

<p>Paul Dano, in a small but vital counterpoint to the more elderly cast, manages to create an enigmatic and consistently interesting arc with a character that would have likely been cartoonish in lesser hands. He is really something special, at least partially because what he manages to achieve is so opaque and resistant to analysis. His performance is both surprising and also seemingly effortless.</p>

<p>The music in <em>Youth</em> is affecting and masterfully placed—both the incidental and the diegetic pieces. The orchestral dénouement, which would otherwise sound hopelessly sentimental, was so extraordinary it obliterated whatever resistance I may have had to its obvious manipulation.   </p>

<p>While I found some of the heightened and deliberately theatrical moments a little difficult to swallow, the entire film still managed to connect in an insightful way, in part because the visual conceits—both the surreal and, in a couple of instances, the brutally real—cohered so beautifully. And at the end I was left regretting how quickly the lights came up. As much as this may be an art house film, it is a far more enriching experience if you allow it to be one of the heart rather than the head.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>In the Star Wars universe, it’s called manifest destiny. But on this planet, it’s just lazy storytelling.</p>

<p>Once upon a time, in a theatre far, far away (from this writer, anyway, born in small-town Alberta in 1983), a movie came out that simultaneously thrilled and shocked the world. <em>The Empire Strikes Back</em> is widely considered the high point of the most beloved franchise in movie history, and remains the gold standard against which sequels are measured. So why have so many storytellers taken the exact wrong lesson from a movie filled with countless technical accomplishments and visceral pleasures?</p>

<p>When Darth Vader reveals to Luke Skywalker (shortly after slicing off his hand) that they share the same blood, it’s a barely-foreshadowed brain-buster that seems to make little-to-no sense in the galaxy-spanning story. So incredulous was the claim that, even after wrapping up the trilogy, George Lucas decided he needed another three films just to make sure that the overly convenient plot-twist didn’t go down as the most cosmic coincidence of all-time. Lucas has claimed that the pre-occupation of father and son, and the ways in which we forge our identities through family relations, has been his sole focus from the very start. No need to play in this billion dollar sandbox any longer, <a href="http://www.bbc.com/news/business-20146942">thank you very much</a>. </p>

<p>But the idea of making the hero and villain related has become so ubiquitous in recent years, you’d think it’s an official step along The Hero’s Journey. And in fact, much of the blame could no doubt be traced back to Joseph Campbell and <em>The Hero with 1000 Faces</em>, which Lucas drew from in order to build his archetypes and make his space opera relatable. But archetype is just the well-spoken cousin of <em>stereo</em>type, and when a media-saturated world is keeping up with Lucas <em>and</em> the Kardashians, a shortcut to depth is too often forced through family ties.</p>

<p>Take the latest James Bond film, <em>Spectre,</em> as one of the most egregious recent examples (spoiler-waring). To one-up the emotional climax in <em>Skyfall</em>, which is accomplished through a symbolic maternal relationship, the only direction the filmmakers felt they could go was to double-down with daddy issues, shared between Bond and his nemesis. Well, phew. I don’t know about you, but I’m finally ready to enjoy the past 50 years of James Bond knowing every world-threatening event was the evil brainchild of a jilted brother.  The series would just be silly otherwise.</p>

<p>Television is just as guilty of committing these sins. Everything from <em>24</em> to <em>Alias</em> has been reduced, at some point, to a Thanksgiving-dinner squabble played out with nuclear launch codes. Not to mention all the blockbuster franchises that have relied on a family twist to either shock us, or try to squeeze out renewed sympathy—from <em>The Dark Knight Rises</em>, to <em>Indiana Jones and the Crystal Skull</em>, to <em>A Good Day to Die Hard</em>, etc. Recent North American democracies are dominated by family dynasties, from The Bushes, to The Clintons, and now The Trudeaus.  We’ve surrendered the everyman element that makes elections and action adventures relatable. It’s no fun imagining that our heroes are only heroic because of nepotism—we get enough of that in real life.</p>

<p>And in case there are any doubts that this trend links back to the original <em>Star Wars</em> trilogy, look no further than the groan (and barf) -inducing revelation that Princess Leia is actually Luke Skywalker’s twin sister. I may have been born the year <em>Return of the Jedi</em> came out, but I can guarantee that golden bikini buzz-kill plot twist wasn’t to thank. Write this down, everyone. Family stories, good; family twists, bad.</p>

<p>I can (almost) look back and laugh at such an ill-conceived plot point. But it’s not so funny when it’s inspiring so many modern stories. There’s a hell of a lot to learn from those original movies, but family dynamics aren’t one of them.Maybe if Darth Vader had been rejected from art school, the series would have been just as good. Better, actually. He doesn’t need to be Winston Churchill’s dad for me to care.</p>

<p>I hope J.J. Abrams takes note.</p>

    <title>I Smile Back</title>

    <id>/content/2015/12/8/i-smile-back</id>
    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>In <em>I Smile Back</em> you have written a direct, if unintentional, rebuke to mumblecore bullshit like Greta Gerwig and Noah Baumbach’s <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/9/4/mistress-america.html"><em>Mistress America</em></a>. Where the latter is coy and hides its arch and ultimately empty purpose behind layers of artifice, <em>I Smile Back</em> just spits it intentions right in your eye.</p>

<p>Sarah Silverman is not high on my list of actresses that I ever expected to admire. But in <em>I Smile Back</em>, Silverman displays the same fearlessness that Charlize Theron so readily employed in 2003’s <em>Monster</em>. There is, however, an ambiguity to Silverman’s performance that is finely tuned. Is she simply someone who suffers from a quiet but profound mental illness? Or has she succumbed to an unrepentant self-indulgence that is only made more unpalatable by her state of cartoonish privilege?</p>

<p>This is a film and a performance that has one thing on its mind—an unsentimental portrayal of just how ugly and existentially empty life can be, even in what seem to be idyllic circumstances. And if that is not necessarily an original concept, the depth and unflinching nature of this film certainly holds it apart from its lesser brethren. </p>

<p>One of the most interesting aspects of a film that is otherwise episodic and choppy—the narrative concerns itself far more with chipping away at the core of Silverman’s character than any specific plot points—is how often the tropes inherent to films about addiction and recovery are subverted. Each time the usual event occurs—reuniting with an absent father or the now clichéd epiphany about how some behaviors are destructive not only to the person engaged in them but to everyone attached to that person—the film turns away from what is expected. Instead we have a scene of a drunken Silverman masturbating on her young daughter’s bedroom floor, while holding a teddy bear. <em>I Smile Back</em> is filled with moments just like that.</p>

<p>The unsettling core of the whole project is the effort made to present Silverman’s illness as part of her character rather than the whole of it. <em>I Smile Back</em> refuses to shift the weight entirely off of the protagonist’s shoulders despite her obvious and very real illness. It is here that the film treads on some dangerous but important ground: it understands that while mental illness is tangible and real there comes a point that whatever the initial circumstance, choices we make often have irrevocable consequences. And that no one, especially when children are involved, has carte blanche—however unfair the circumstances of their existence.</p>

<p><em>I Smile Back</em> is a vaccination against a particular kind of Oprah-esque, feel-good nonsense that is often employed in portrayals of addiction and depression. It is also a tremendous performance by a woman playing an almost entirely unsympathetic character. Silverman makes a strong case for herself as a modern day female equivalent to Travis Bickle. Both are repugnant and still also caught in the throes of something they can’t really control or understand.</p>

<p>I believe Sarah Silverman would have made John Cassavetes a happy man, and I can’t think of higher praise for an actress. You gave her the raw material to make that hyperbolic praise difficult to refute, Paige, and while I won’t thank you for it, I still respect the hell of out what you both managed to create.</p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>While it may seem like the obvious choice to address this letter to you, it’s also the only choice. Because what <em>Legend</em> is really about—rather than an exploration of the infamous London gangsters, the Kray twins—is displaying your mercurial talents.</p>

<p>When people use the term “star vehicle” <em>Legend</em> could be held up as the platonic ideal. And what a purring E-Type it is—every moment onscreen is filled an inescapable Tom Hardy-ness. From the opening frame of this rose colored paean to a mythic 1960’s London, <em>Legend</em> is far more interested in you as a performer than telling any particular story. </p>

<p>You are the most interesting English language male actor in the last thirty or forty years: half Paul Newman, one part Cary Grant and more than a little Robert Mitchum. You are also one of the few artists that is worth paying money to see for your performance alone, regardless of the writing, direction, or subject matter. And every scene of <em>Legend</em>—whether you are playing the unapologetically gay, batshit insane Ronnie, or the smooth-as-glass, bespoke-suited Reggie—is possessed by your presence. The whole film’s center of gravity lurches around after you whenever you move through the frame.</p>

<p>The fact that you are so compelling as an actor can be both a feature and a bug. In a film where your character(s) is/are the focal point that magnetism is generally useful since your talents tends to soften some of the elements that would undermine the narrative—whereas in a something like <em>Lawless</em> you tend to overwhelm lesser actors (cough—LaBeouf—cough) to the extent that the film feels lopsided and uneven. </p>

<p>There are only a few scenes when you are on camera with yourself and these are the high points of the film. The sheer virtuosity of one individual playing twins while creating two entirely differentiated personalities is a goddamn magic trick. Aside from the comparison to Jeremy Irons in Cronenberg’s <em>Dead Ringers</em> (a film that gave the central performance far more support) there isn’t anything that comes close. One specific scene early on in the film—where you both kick the piss out of some rival gang members—is technically proficient and also a great example of how it’s possible to express character through action, rather than dialogue. Director Brian Helgeland doesn’t always make great choices (the voice over really was terribly clunky and inept) but he was astute in giving your characters space to breathe as individuals, while still underlining the inexorable and ultimately destructive pull each of them had on the other.</p>

<p>The fact that it is possible to evaluate Reggie and Ronnie as separate performances is probably the highest praise I can give. You managed to turn a glossy nothing of a film into something pretty memorable. Next time I hope the film surrounding you rises to your level. </p>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p><em>Victor Frankenstein</em> is a film of such obvious conceits that you can almost hear the elevator pitch. “So… imagine Guy Ritchie directing a gothic romance/monster movie with homoerotic overtones.”</p>

<p>“Magic!”</p>

<p>The film is a tired and largely unimaginative retelling of Mary Shelly’s <strong>Frankenstein.</strong> The only potentially interesting change is that it is told largely from the POV of Igor—played gamely by Daniel Radcliffe. Even that conceit falls prey to your tendency to see every narrative as a way to stitch together various genre tropes in what you consider new and interesting ways.  </p>

<p>Max, you are the epitome of self-circumscription (pun intended). Your definition of screenwriting, as it currently exists on your IMDB page, all but guarantees what you write will always end up as creatively vacuous as <em>Victor Frankenstein,</em> or this year’s underwhelming <em>American Ultra.</em> You might want to consider that the emptiness of your work has more to do with your writing than it has to do with the environment you lament. </p>

<p>It is not the visual excess, or the overt genre busting, or the playful edges that exist in the protagonist’s relationship that drag this film into the swampland of mediocrity—the same mire that the aforementioned Ritchie’s <em>Sherlock Holmes</em> or even the <em>Underworld</em> series swim in. No Max, it is the relentless lack of any kind of real character that wrecks this film utterly. There is not one genuine human voice anywhere in this work.</p>

<p>James McAvoy, as the titular Victor, chews every single ounce of the set he can sink his teeth into in a failed effort to inject some heart into what is essentially a filmmaking exercise rather than an actual movie. That McAvoy fails miserably is not for lack of effort, but simply there is nothing here for him to grab hold of. The story is literally a series of obvious signposts that see it lurch forward with no more intention or purpose than if a drunk followed a single high-banked road. It is as if you think it is possible to just skip the basics of plot and character by using visual and literary tropes to stand in for these essential elements.</p>

<p>Every scene is played as a nod and a wink at what came before (if I see one more iteration of the “it’s alive!” moment I will remove my own eyes with an ice cream scoop). As a consequence, the film rests on the idea that its weight comes from what <em>Victor Frankenstein</em> references rather than creating it’s own center of gravity. There is no skeleton here to hang the meat of the monster on—so the whole thing falls to pieces.</p>

<p>For a film that works hard to incorporate every Frankenstein moment <em>ever</em>—from the Hammer films to a half-clever nod to Mel Brooks <em>Young Frankenstein—</em>there is an undercurrent of dismissal that permeates <em>Victor Frankenstein.</em> If you don’t understand or respect the underlying strength of the source material, then why bother Max?</p>

<p>In fact, if there is one question I would really be curious to ask you Max, it is this: why should any of us bother when you clearly do not?</p>

    <title>Trumbo</title>

    <content type="html"><![CDATA[ <p>Combing through a script to verify historically accuracy, pointing out legal conflicts and continuity errors, making suggestions for alternatives—you don’t have an easy job, Malcolm. Even under the simplest of circumstances. And with <em>Trumbo</em>, you were given a script about one of the darkest moments in Hollywood’s history: the jailing and blacklisting of screenwriters accused of Communism in post-WWII America. </p>

<p>So, you know—no pressure. </p>

<p>I can imagine your conundrum. You have a real-life story that takes place during a time of great cultural and political change, colourful characters and toothsome subject matter, but the script itself is jokey, plodding, and decidedly small-screen in its scope. Do you speak up? Or do you just keep mum to stay employed? 
The real crime here is that 
this period of history – so bleakly fascinating, and featuring the most famous of all blacklisted writers -  is given such humdrum treatment.  </p>

<p>Dalton Trumbo was already living comfortably as one of the most famous scribes in Hollywood when his support of striking film workers singled him out as an agitator. With the threat of the Red Menace reaching panic levels, U.S. Congress called a hearing to determine which writers in Hollywood were Communists. Trumbo and nine others, dubbed the Hollywood 10, were held in contempt and jailed for their political beliefs. Once released, Trumbo continued writing under pseudonyms, employing his family as a scriptwriting sweat-shop to get his work out. When word leaked that Trumbo had, by proxy, written Oscar-winners <em>Roman Holiday</em> and <em>The Brave One</em>, it became difficult to keep Hollywood heavyweights like Kirk Douglas (<em>Spartacus</em>) and Otto Preminger (<em>Exodus</em>) away. Trumbo was determined to get his name back on the credits and off of the blacklist. </p>

<p>But the film <em>Trumbo</em> is nothing more than proof that we have reached “peak biopic”. It’s full of big name actors – Bryan Cranston as Trumbo, Helen Mirren as gossip-columnist Hedda Hopper, Diane Lane as Cleo Trumbo – all playing one-dimensional characters who meander through a by-the-numbers story intent on showing audiences <em>just how far we’ve come</em>. In your research you must have found so many interesting sub-plots and lesser-known players that could have given this film a little more depth. Instead, it strives so much to be an <em>Important _Film</em> that, much like the House Un-American Activities Committee, it becomes a victim of its own hubris.</p>

<p>The stuff the script gets right, like Trumbo’s huge personality and self-righteousness, are well-served by an actor like Bryan Cranston. It’s clear that his mugging on <em>Malcolm in the Middle</em> prepared him to chew some period-appropriate scenery. Director Jay Roach, better known for helming <em>Austin Powers</em> and <em>Meet the Parents</em>, doesn’t seem to know whether he’s making a comedy or a drama, and both elements suffer. His mis-casting of Louis CK as a doomed member of the Hollywood 10 proves this point. It seems like CK was given free rein to re-write his own dialogue. I feel for you, Malcolm; keeping up with his anachronisms must have given you writer’s cramp.</p>

<p>CK’s character is a composite, which in itself must have been a head-scratcher for you, considering the wealth of fascinating real-life writers screenwriter John McNamara could have brought to life (<a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0488057/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1">Ring Lardner Jr.</a> and <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0778789/?ref_=fn_al_nm_1">Adrian Scott</a>, to name just two). Or maybe you tried and failed to get clearance from the families who wanted nothing to do with this trifle.</p>

<p>The real heart of the story is supposed to be Trumbo’s difficult relationship with his family, who must suffer his verbal abuse while he writes in the tub, high on Bennies. But the more interesting relationship is the one he has with actor Edward G. Robinson, who sold out others to save his career. Michael Stuhlbarg looks nothing like Robinson, but he and Cranston generate the film’s most honest moments. One is a man who refuses to give up his ideals, the other is a man torn between doing what’s right and doing what’s best for him, and they’re both trying to stay alive in the cutthroat world of the Hollywood film industry. </p>

<p>It’s a shame that a movie about one of the greatest screenwriters who ever lived is so uninspired. A story like this deserves more gravitas, fewer guffaws. Instead of telling a serious story and injecting it with humour, we got a lot of slap-happy hijinks and over-the top moralizing. I’m not sure who exactly on this film should be held responsible for turning in such a mess, but I don’t expect you to name names. You’ve been through enough.</p>
