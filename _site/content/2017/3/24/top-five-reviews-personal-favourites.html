As a collective of film nerds, we get off on finding different ways to look at a film’s production or think about its meaning. And after five years, there are times we feel we’ve done that better than others.</p> <p>So here they are, each critic’s <strong>favourite reviews they’ve written</strong> during the DC&amp;C Era (past five years) – which rarely correspond with our favourite <em>films</em> from the past five years (that Top 5 coming soon!).</p> <p>Please note: not ranked – but with a small description for each.</p> <hr> <p><u><strong>Christopher Redmond’s Top 5 Fav Reviews</strong></u></p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/9/10/prisoners.html"><em>Prisoners</em></a><br> Jared once said he liked this review, which automatically makes it one of my favourites. Plus, when I <a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/4/17/a-conversation-with-director-denis-villeneuve.html">interviewed Denis Villeneuve</a> a few months later, I asked him to shout-out a below-the-line crew member that he thought wouldn’t otherwise be recognized. He praised Bruce Hamme. Blew my mind.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/3/11/enemy.html"><em>Enemy</em></a><br> Another review for a Villeneuve film, but writing this one somehow made me understand (or at least enjoy) the film more.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/8/16/dream-house.html"><em>Dream House</em></a><br> When you have a chance to take your anger against the sub-prime mortgage crisis out on an appallingly bad movie called <em>Dream House</em> – you hit that shit hard.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/4/12/american-reunion.html"><em>American Reunion</em></a><br> It’s so simple, but it works. At 149 words, it’s one of our shortest reviews too.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/10/28/the-16-sexiest-roles-on-a-film-set.html"><em>The 16 Sexiest Roles on a Film Set</em></a><br> I’ve written a few dozen essays over the years, so I wanted some representation of that. They aren’t usually this silly, but the real goal was to give every on-set department some praise, peppered with a bit of insight. That’s the whole goal of the site, after all.</p> <p><em>Honourable mention:</em></p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/3/2/the-artist.html"><em>The Artist</em></a><br> Not only my first review, but the first DC&amp;C review, period. It was intended as a proof-point that we could make the site’s concept work writ-large and a template I personally tried to follow for not including a standard plot synopsis, taking a slightly ironic approach (writing to a sound tech on a silent film), and referencing the recipient’s previous work. Not my favourite review by any means, but a meaningful one.</p> <hr> <p><u><strong>Jared Young’s Top 5 Fav Reviews</strong></u></p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/3/22/olympus-has-fallen.html"><em>Olympus Has Fallen</em></a><br> I still can’t decide how sarcastic I was being with this five-star review, but I nonetheless enjoyed writing a little paean to the awesome action soundtracks of my youth.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/7/27/the-dark-knight-rises.html"><em>The Dark Knight Rises</em></a><br> Me at my most self-righteous.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/5/7/shame.html"><em>Shame</em></a><br> The anatomical review that started a Dear Cast and Crew craze.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/2/24/straight-outta-comptopn.html"><em>Straight Outta Compton</em></a><br> I still struggle with some of the questions I posed in this review: how do you reconcile with the work of an artist who commits terrible acts in their private life?</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/2/5/mr-turner.html"><em>Mr. Turner</em></a><br> I’m not sure I can clearly explain why I’m so fond of this particular review; it was a tough one to write, but it turned out to feel (to me, at least) very genuine. Also, it’s written to a guy named Dick Pope.</p> <hr> <p><u><strong>Casey Tourangeau’s Top 5 Fav Reviews</strong></u></p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/4/26/the-lucky-one.html"><em>The Lucky One</em></a><br> My first full-length review for the site. Sometimes the first time is the best.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/1/9/sorry-the-lego-movie-is-the-best-film-of-2014.html"><em>Sorry, The Lego Movie is the Best Film of 2014</em></a><br> I had a lot of trepidation naming a movie best of the year for such personal reasons, but the resulting piece justified its selection.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/1/7/wolf-of-wall-street.html"><em>The Wolf of Wall Street</em></a><br> This review was as much a reaction to some criticism I thought was invalid (attacking it for the actions of its real-life subject, instead of how it’s treated on screen) as it was review of the movie itself. Either way, it forced me into a deep dive I rarely get the chance to take.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/2/15/a-good-day-to-die-hard.html"><em>A Good Day to Die Hard</em></a><br> As much fun as I had systematically taking this apart, I wish my review could have simply been what the person sitting next to me yelled during a scene in which the sound drops out in an effort to inspire awe: “BOOOOOOOO!!!”</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/10/1/cloudy-with-a-chance-of-meatballs-2.html"><em>Cloudy with a Chance of Meatballs 2</em></a><br> This must be the most aggressive I’ve ever felt writing a review. The fact that it was aimed at a cynical children’s film made it feel all the better.</p> <hr> <p><u><strong>Di Golding’s Top 5 Fav Reviews</strong></u></p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/12/19/grudge-match.html"><em>Grudge Match</em></a><br> My first review for DC&amp;C. I showed my first draft to Tim McEown (my friend of 16 years who lovingly refers to me as Her Vagesty, Queen of Ascerbia), and he recommended I maybe scale back my hostility until I’d established a rapport with the rest of the team. So I sent a toned down revised draft to Christopher Redmond who asked if I could maybe amp up my vitriol. I knew then that I’d found my people.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/6/15/still-not-over-the-canyon-thelma-and-louise-at-25.html"><em>Still Not Over the Canyon: Thelma and Louise at 25</em></a><br> What I love most about writing for DC&amp;C is the freedom I have to write what I want, how I want. This essay is about one of my favourite films, and what has (and hasn’t) changed for women in front of and behind the camera in 25+ years.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/8/1/amy.html"><em>Amy</em></a><br> I do my best to go into a film with minimal expectations. That said, I thought I knew what this film was going to be, and I was glad to be wrong. If I could go back and give it another star, I would.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/11/27/creed.html"><em>Creed</em></a><br> My DC&amp;C compatriots revere a film from the mid-70s that went on to spawn a franchise that has endured for the last four decades and is poised to continue to do so for the foreseeable future. So do I. Theirs features a Wookie. Mine features an Italian Stallion. Apologies to Jared Young who somehow always gets the unenviable task of editing one of my Rocky pieces (three and counting).</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/4/30/we-need-to-talk-about-adam.html"><em>We Need to Talk About Adam</em></a><br> As long as his movies keep getting greenlit, we will never not need to talk about Adam.</p> <hr> <p><u><strong>Tim McEown’s Top 5 Fav Reviews</strong></u></p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/8/22/kubo-and-the-two-strings.html"><em>Kubo and The Two Strings</em></a><br> Most fun review because I got to talk about Noh theatre, Ray Harryhausen, Samurai and Monkeys. Hard to beat that.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/8/22/kubo-and-the-two-strings.html"><em>Mistress America</em></a><br> Sometimes it’s childishly fulfilling to be able to sincerely dump on people’s sacred cows.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/12/9/jackie.html"><em>Jackie</em></a><br> This was, for me, the most difficult review I’ve had to write because the film was so technically complex. I worked harder on this than any other review I’ve written.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2014/10/29/nightcrawler.html"><em>Nightcrawler</em></a><br> This was the first review where I began to understand what exactly I wanted to do when writing about films.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/2/19/hail-caesar.html"><em>Hail, Caesar!</em></a><br> Best time at the movies I’ve had in a very long time. So easy to write.</p> <hr> <p><u><strong>Nat Master’s Top 5 Fav Reviews</strong></u></p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2017/1/19/elle-is-the-best-and-angriest-film-of-2016.html"><em>Elle is the Best (and Angriest) Film of 2016</em></a><br> I got to rage against The Patriarchy, which is always fun (and essential).</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/11/23/the-night-before.html"><em>The Night Before</em></a><br> I enjoyed writing this so much I briefly considered formatting all my reviews as poems going forward, but then I changed my mind, so you were all spared my haiku on the undercurrent of misogyny in <em>The Peanuts Movie</em>.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/2/4/leviathan.html"><em>Leviathan</em></a><br> I feel like this one makes me sound really insightful and smart, which is a marked departure from my usual stream of cursing and complaining.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/1/4/love.html"><em>Love</em></a><br> You guys don’t even know how many truly awful 3D dick puns there were in my original draft.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/5/3/a-hologram-for-the-king.html"><em>A Hologram for the King</em></a><br> The guy I addressed the review to actually sent us a lovely, gracious email expressing thanks for my comments, which was so nice because I am constantly paranoid that addressees will be super-offended by my reviews and @ me all like, “Hey, fuck you!”</p> <hr> <p><u><strong>Ankit Verma’s Top 5 Fav Reviews</strong></u></p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/2/29/gods-of-egypt.html"><em>Gods of Egypt</em></a><br> I love going on a good rant. I find it therapeutic. Chicken soup for the soul. <em>Gods of Egypt</em> gave me so much ammo to unleash, I found myself in a zen-like state of pure bliss by the end.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2015/7/2/magic-mike-xxl.html"><em>Magic Mike XXL</em></a><br> <em>Magic Mike XXL</em> was the first review where I was so sure about my pick for letter recipient, that I hammered out a draft in under 20 minutes. Plus, I got to use the phrase, ’ass-less-iest of ass-less chaps’ which is historic in its own right.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/8/2/nerve.html"><em>Nerve</em></a><br> Sometimes it’s good to go into a movie with low expectations so you can be blown away by how utterly real it is.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/10/27/jack-reacher-never-go-back.html"><em>Jack Reacher: Never Go Back</em></a><br> Call it nostalgia or call it bad taste; I have a strange soft-spot for lame 90’s action movies. <em>Jack Reacher: Never Go Back</em> was the ultimate throwback.</p> <p><a href="http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2017/1/23/captain-america-civil-war-is-the-best-and-worthiest-film-of-2016.html"><em>Captain America: Civil War is the Best (and Worthiest) Film of 2016</em></a><br> 2016 was a fantastic year for critically-acclaimed movies. So, when it came down to choosing the best of the best, I stuck with my gut and chose a superhero movie that transcended its genre and exceeded all of my expectations. I still get death threats to this day.
