  bio: 'Cory discovered his interest in analyzing movies by trying to convince people to watch Primer and by arguing that Top Gun and Black Hawk Down helped create the world we live in today. He''s has been writing and designing stuff online since his first T1 connection at University of California, Berkeley, where he studied biology, cognitive psychology, and bizness. Along the way he has won awards as a copywriter and digital strategist in several countries and industries. Cory picked a favorite movie and then immediately convinced himself that he was wrong and that a different movie was a much better choice. Both movies probably had Bill Murray in them.'

  bio: "Nat grew up on a steady diet of Bollywood cinema, as there was little else to watch in Dubai in the mid 1980s. Her lifelong love of cinema led her to pursue a master’s degree in Film Studies at Carleton University after pretending to major in Political Science. A freelance writer with a day job, Nat owns every film ever made by or featuring Edward Burns (even the one with the dinosaur), and secretly hopes Dear Cast & Crew will review Bollywood movies someday."

And working in the same video store for a decade or so as well as partnering with her as a summertime review team for CBC radio's All in a Day. Tim is a writer and photographer and aspires to add a third vocation to that list—just for the sake of symmetry. He lives in Toronto with his wife Sarah, and their cat Finian. Tim has had his work published in the New York Times and Readers Digest. Which yes, is still a thing."
