<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><strong><em>Dear Cast and Crew of Arrow,</em></strong><em> S1E01 &ndash; &ldquo;Pilot&rdquo;</em><em>&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p><em>Original air date:</em> October 10, 2012</p>
<p><em>Synopsis:<br /></em>In this episode, Jack wakes up on the beach after Oceanic Flight 815 crashes into a mysterious island that&hellip;no, wait. Sorry. In this episode, Oliver Queen returns to Starling City after being shipwrecked for five years. He uses his newfound survivalist skills to fight crime. With a bow and arrow. Obviously.</p>
<p><em>Shownotes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Cold open: forest running! You&rsquo;re really paying off on your elevator pitch, &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fourth season of <em>Lost</em>, but with more bows and arrows.&rdquo; (JY)</li>
<li>Three minutes in and I&rsquo;m already missing Stephen Amell&rsquo;s beard from the cold open. (CR)</li>
<li>Terrific headline: &ldquo;Lost Billionaire Found!&rdquo; (JY)</li>
<li>Starling City? Changing the name of Star City makes no sense, but I&rsquo;ll let it pass. (JY)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Laurel&rdquo; Lance? No. No. I can&rsquo;t let this one pass.&nbsp; (JY)</li>
<li>Cocky billionaire playboy who fights crime alongside unflappable love interest and loyal chauffeur? Please update elevator pitch to read: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fourth season of <em>Lost</em>, starring Tony Stark, with bows and arrows.&rdquo; (JY)</li>
<li>Rooftop parkour chase! Machine gunnery! This entire sequence is&hellip;surprisingly well-done for an hour-long network TV drama. Almost <em>too</em> well-done. Please save some production budget for later episodes to avoid an inevitable decline. (JY)</li>
<li>&ldquo;Nobody can know my secret!&rdquo; Did he just break that guy&rsquo;s neck? (JY)</li>
<li>No lame tranquilizer darts instead of arrows&mdash;he actually kills people! This show has a fighting chance. (CR)</li>
<li>&ldquo;A Queen&rsquo;s ransom, as it were!&rdquo; I see what you did there. Because his name is Oliver Queen. So you switched the words. (wink*) (JY)</li>
<li>Steven Amell&rsquo;s stubble: consistently rugged and sexy throughout. Props to makeup department. (JY)</li>
<li>Steven Amell&rsquo;s secret warehouse: pretty generic. Who ships with wooden crates anymore? We need to make up for the props department. (JY)</li>
<li><em>Cast Away</em> D.O.P. Don Burgess deserves a royalty check for that shot where Oliver&rsquo;s girlfriend gets sucked out to sea. (CR)</li>
<li>Police sketch clearly drawn by famed Green Arrow artist Mike Grell. I think. Mike Grell is still alive, right? (JY)</li>
<li>Wait. Lives in chateau-style mansion. Dank hideout with tech-nerd workspace surrounded in computer displays? Please update elevator pitch to read: &ldquo;It&rsquo;s the fourth season of <em>Lost</em>, starring Bruce Wayne, with bows and arrows.&rdquo; (JY)</li>
<li>Training montage! You&rsquo;re hitting the right notes, here. Almost making up for the pointless renaming of Star City (but not quite). (JY)</li>
<li>Oliver is somehow (still?) a cyber wiz 5 years after living like a caveman? </li>
<li>Villain cowering in the back seat of a car, listening to the whoops and whooshes of his henchmen being taken out before being pulled unceremoniously out the window to cower beneath our crouching hero? Totally original! (JY)</li>
<li>(Please amend title of this episode to: &ldquo;Arrow Begins&rdquo;.) (JY)</li>
<li>(Please add Christopher Nolan&rsquo;s name to directing credits.) (JY)</li>
<li>Seriously, though. I&rsquo;m impressed by the fight choreography. (JY)</li>
</ul>
<p>As disappointed as I am with what you&rsquo;ve done with the Green Arrow canon (Laurel? <em>Laurel!?</em> She&rsquo;s not a hippie aunt, she&rsquo;s <em>Mockingbird</em>!), I suppose I&rsquo;m convinced enough by your quality portrayal of the ultra-violence that I will be back next week. (JY)</p>
