<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong><em>Dear Cast and Crew of Nashville,</em></strong><em> S1E07 &ndash; &ldquo;Lovesick Blues&rdquo;</em></span></p>
<p><em>Episode synopsis:</em><br />Marshall pushes Rayna and Juliette to perform a duet. Meanwhile, Peggy&#8217;s behavior forces Teddy to be honest with Rayna; Scarlett tries to move on from Avery by bonding with Gunnar.</p>
<p><em>Original air date:</em><br />November 28, 2012</p>
<p><em>Shownotes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>In Nashville, rich producers cheer with their whisky flasks. Classy. </li>
<li>Is that NFL player making out with Juliette or in CPR training? </li>
<li>Tabloid headline calls Juliette &ldquo;Country Cryptonite&rdquo;! How insulting &ndash; spelling it with a &ldquo;C&rdquo; to make her sound old.</li>
<li>Juliette struts angrily towards the camera FTW! Grrrow.</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s with these low-angle shots between Juliette and record exec?&nbsp; Did the D.O.P. just get lazy and set the camera on a table ?</li>
<li>Teddy is suggesting they watch a documentary on family movie night? Let me guess &ndash; <em>The Life and Times of Harvey Milk</em>?</li>
<li>Rayna sure is taking it well that Teddy has to leave in the middle of the night! Oh, right, they get to watch a chick-flick now instead. </li>
<li>When someone keeps &ldquo;threatening&rdquo; to release your greatest hits album: #FirstWorldProblemsOfThe0.0001%</li>
<li>Those stain glass windows in the Ryman Auditorium aren&rsquo;t too subtle about the self-proclaimed importance of that venue, are they?</li>
<li>&ldquo;The best way to get over someone is to get under someone else.&rdquo; Nashville just found their new tagline!</li>
<li>First cover song on the show is &ldquo;Ring of Fire&rdquo; by Scarlett. Short and sweet &ndash; both the singer and the song.</li>
<li>I guess Gunner is trying to earn his name by shooting off his mouth like a jerk.</li>
<li>Deacon just had the perfect song in his back pocket. Literally. </li>
<li>As pathetic and immature as Juliette&rsquo;s &ldquo;What, are you gay?&rdquo; comment was because the NFL player wouldn&rsquo;t have sex with her, it seems like a legit question.</li>
<li>It looks like the Nashville cab company just parks a running car outside Avery&rsquo;s house for Scarlett&rsquo;s inevitable storm-outs.</li>
<li>Rayna and Juliette can&rsquo;t handle picking a duet song together, but they think writing one will be easier? This should be good.</li>
<li>Producer, on the Rayna and Juliette collaboration, as if reading my mind: &ldquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t want to get between those two. Well actually, I would.&rdquo;</li>
<li>And now the first musical star cameo by none other than&hellip;. Wyclef Jean? </li>
<li>The guitar lick is good. The chorus is catchy. The duet, ladies and gentlemen, just lived up to the hype!</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Closing comments</em>: I assume the Avery and Scarlett relationship will be a long arc drama of the show, but glad to see she&rsquo;s committed to writing with Gunner again &ndash; that&rsquo;s where the show gets the best songs and performances. But the stars shined bright in this one with that closing number. The slow motion John Hughes shot at the end may have felt like a season finale, but it looks like Nashville is just getting started.</p>
