<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><em><strong>Dear Eiko Ishioka,</strong> Costume Designer,&nbsp;</em></span></p>
<p>There are many reasons to make movies. Jon Peters tried for years to make a movie just so that he could see a giant mechanical spider onscreen. Sony rebooted a Spider-Man franchise barely a decade old just to maintain the creative rights to the character. And the entire second half of Nicolas Cage&rsquo;s career seems to be an endurance test (for both him and audiences) in the service of paying off his income tax debts.&nbsp;</p>
<p>And what&rsquo;s the reason for <em>Mirror, Mirror</em>? Well, that becomes clear about a third of the way through the film: swan hats.</p>
<p>This was a real coup for you, Eiko. And clearly made the most of the opportunity &ndash; you&rsquo;ve been nominated for an Academy Award! Congratulations! Talk about putting a feather in your cap.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s also something admirable about director Tarsem Singh&rsquo;s attempt to imbue a modern colloquial tone into a classical fairy-tale treatment of the Snow White story. Unfortunately, the substance of this movie seems to be not in the form, but in the style&mdash;much of which is expressed in your golden cloaks and stunning ball gowns and elaborate costume-ball get-ups (which is where we get to see the swan hats, the bunny-ears top-hat, the antler hat, etc.).</p>
<p>That focus on aesthetics, while pleasant, comes with a price. The chemistry between Lily Collins and Armie Hammer feels wasted, Nathan Lane seems only to be operating at three-quarters efficiency, and Julia Roberts, who plays the wicked witch like the darkest timeline version of Vivian from <em>Pretty Woman</em>, can&rsquo;t quite chew the scenery fast enough (and there&rsquo;s <em>a lot</em> of scenery).&nbsp;</p>
<p>But what does it matter to you? This is a film made to showcase your talents, and as an amateur fashionisto, I can say that they are considerable. Best of luck on Oscar night, and, please, if you can, send me a link to where I can purchase one of those hats. &nbsp;</p>
<p>Sincerely,&nbsp;</p>
<p>Jared Young</p>
