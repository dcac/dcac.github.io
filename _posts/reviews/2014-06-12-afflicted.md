<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of buzz online about <em>Afflicted</em>, the little Canadian horror film that could. This very well might be due to the fact that they worked with a savvy professional like you. Except this is a sustained buzz &ndash; not the kind that&rsquo;s not based on a goofy title (<em><a href="/content/2013/7/17/sharknado.html">Sharknado</a></em>, <em><a href="/content/2014/6/5/wolfcop.html">Wolfcop</a></em>) or a gruesome premise (<em>Human Centipede</em>).  Instead, you were promoting something with actual value: great production, smart execution, and a satisfying payoff.</p>
<p>Is it only a coincidence that the film&rsquo;s central premise <em>also</em> revolves around the life-sucking power of new media?</p>
<p>You know what I mean.</p>
<p>Cliff Prowse and Derek Lee co-direct and co-write as co-stars, and in the first section of the film we follow their excellent adventure from Vancouver to Europe as they shoot, edit, and post videos of themselves on their year-long trip around the world. The selfie-style cinematography puts the film in the found footage genre, even if the moniker doesn&rsquo;t strictly apply. The video isn&rsquo;t being pieced together retroactively, so the first sections of the film are designed to replicate those energetic, title-happy YouTube videos that have come to define a generation. Derek&rsquo;s precarious health is the catalyst of the journey, but also sets the stage for the film&rsquo;s darker developments.</p>
<p>These are the elements that you &ndash; and any marketing person &ndash; would likely want to focus on. But the strength of <em>Afflicted</em> is that the filmmakers don&rsquo;t lose themselves in the restrictions of the genre. Like the Derek character, whose body begins to transform, so to does <em>Afflicted</em>&mdash;into something that bears a much closer resemblance to Josh Trank&rsquo;s <em>Chronicle </em>than <em>Quarantine</em>. The story moves along at an energetic pace, and the trick cinematography, combined with seamless visual effects, allows us to believe that this is all taking place in a state of semi-reality we&rsquo;re familiar with.</p>
<p>Most refreshingly, the film doesn&rsquo;t exist simply to carry a few GIF worthy moments. Instead, it takes the hard road: developing its characters, sustaining our interest with engaging plot developments, and building steam towards the finale (instead of losing it). The lesson being, I hope, that earned praise is tweetable, too.</p>
<p>Happily infected,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
