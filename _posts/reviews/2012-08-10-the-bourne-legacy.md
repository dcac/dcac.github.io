<p>Well, well, look who they brought in to save the Bourne franchise. First you try to make us forget Arnold Schwarzenegger with a new <em>Total Recall</em>, and now you pull a fancypants switcheroo on Matt Damon. Nice try, Mr. &ldquo;Character Rigger&rdquo;, but just because you&rsquo;re an expert at tampering with another writer&rsquo;s original creations doesn&rsquo;t mean I&rsquo;ll swallow whatever you&rsquo;re feeding me. I&rsquo;m going to slowly, unevenly, and predictably rebel against your Hollywood mind-control program, and then give you a lot less action than expected.</p>
<p>How do you like them oranges?</p>
<p>The first part of <em>The Bourne Legacy</em> makes sure Jason The Forgetful Superspy is credited as the original problem with the government&rsquo;s top secret Treadstone program. Your next trick is to run sideways with the Bourne-iverse, having the events of <em>The Bourne Ultimatum</em> happen in tandem with the program&rsquo;s implosion in <em>Legacy</em>.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s like they say; you can take the Jason out of the Bourne movies, but you can&rsquo;t take the Bourne movies out of Jason. This part is well played.</p>
<p>The new story follows Aaron Cross, another chemically enhanced soldier, trying to avoid being wiped out when the head honchos decide to control-alt-delete their entire human experiment. But you, and they, should know that dealing with such volatile characters isn&rsquo;t easy. Yet you all tinker with these soldiers and spies like they&rsquo;re toys.</p>
<p>The most improbable behavioral twist is early on when a kill code prompts a genetic scientist to murder-suicide his whole crew at gunpoint. We&rsquo;ve seen far too many of these real-life meltdowns recently in the news, but a pill induced instant mental flip still feels far fetched. True motivations and consequences are compelling. Magical science that co-opts true tragedy is just lazy.</p>
<p>Your biggest doctoring, of course, is recasting the lead with Jeremy Renner. Sure he plays a new character, but that&rsquo;s a creative technicality. The audience is buying into a brand, which means we expect certain patterns and palettes to be followed. Superficially you succeed. They&rsquo;re both blonde! On the other hand, Tony Gilroy (Bourne&rsquo;s ongoing series screenwriter) decided as director to mostly disregard Paul Greengrass&rsquo; signature shaky-cam nausea and slow everything the hell down &ndash; but to the point you wonder if the cameraman fell asleep. Worse, there are no double-crosses, layered spy intrigue or compelling B-stories to compensate for this switch in style. Just more of the same cat-and-mouse chases and undercooked romances. Bourne&rsquo;s original mission of self-discovery is simply replaced with Ward&rsquo;s addiction to government pills. Adding a few smiles and quips just renders it a generic off-the-shelf offering we&rsquo;ve seen before.</p>
<p>In other words, your elaborate attempts at faceting new characters based on the old prototypes feels wasted. There&rsquo;s nothing particularly wrong with <em>The Bourne Legacy</em> as an action/spy film, other than maybe an excessive runtime. But why water down the legacy?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
<p>P.S. I may not have looked up the actual definition of your job&hellip;</p>
