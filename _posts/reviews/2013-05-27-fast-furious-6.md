<p>CRASH! BANG! ZOOM! In a <em>Fast and Furious</em> world, this is the code to live by. And God love it. What more do you need, right?</p>
<p>After being an effects artist on <em>Fast &amp; Furious </em>(part 4 &ndash; the de facto franchise reboot) you were promoted to the &lsquo;drill sergeant of danger&rsquo; on <em>Fast 5 &ndash; </em>a film where your incredibly staged action sequences took the series to another level. Now you&rsquo;ve done it again, this time turning the characters into full-on death-defying superheroes. But something else has changed. A fourth word has been added to the series manifesto in this sixth film, spoken no less than two dozen times (I lost count). Say it with me: Family.&nbsp; Sorry&hellip; FAMILY!</p>
<p>&ldquo;But why?&rdquo; you must have asked. &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve got races on mountain cliffs, London streets, freeway bridges and airline tarmacs. And an army tank, dammit!&rdquo; Yes you do, and frankly, they are used to rather spectacular effect. Locking your action on a narrow plain proves a pure and simple principle: anticipation is just as important as surprise. Think <em>Speed</em> or <em>The French Connection</em>. Unlike the mess of modern action movies, where shaky cameras and frenetic editing try to save sloppy sequencing, <em>Fast &amp; Furious</em> 6 is serviced with silky smooth cinematography so we can actually see what&rsquo;s happening. In return, we appreciate the surprises.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So after six films, I guess you should have seen this coming &ndash; it&rsquo;s not just about the cars anymore, it&rsquo;s about FAMILY.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s right, in a series defined by alternating characters, rotating roles and confusing titles (this film is actually called <em>Furious 6 </em>in the opening credits), all the pieces from the past have assembled (Assemble!) for this big reunion &ndash; Vin Disel, Paul Walker, Chris &ldquo;Ludacris&rdquo; Bridges, Tyrese Gibson, Jordana Brewster, Sung Kang, Gal Gadot and Dyawne &#8220;The Rock&rdquo; Johnson &ndash; in addition to some new blood. Even the once-dead Michelle Rodriguez is resurrected, without her memory, in that classic comic book way. As for character names, they&rsquo;re forgettable and irrelevant. What matters is that we care about the faces behind the wheel. This time, we&rsquo;re following the band of now multi-millionaire criminals doing a job for the Law, but always for &ldquo;family&rdquo; reasons. And by telling us how much they care about each other ad nauseum, the feeling can&rsquo;t help but rub off on us a bit. I might have a hard time telling the films a part, but at least I could appreciate the emotional consequences to your action scenes.</p>
<p>See, unlike almost every other franchise, ever, <em>Fast and Furious</em> is actually getting better with age. In some ways, it&rsquo;s like a customized car that keeps getting louder, faster and more ridiculous looking. But the series is now convincingly revving its engines against the biggest blockbusters out there. It has <em>Mission: Impossible </em>gadgets<em>, </em>James Bond babes and demographic crossover appeal. Even with all the muscle heads and lug nuts, this film finds a way to balance every gratuitous bikini ass shot with a kick-ass female action scene (welcoming Mixed Martial Arts queen Gina Carano to the family helps).</p>
<p>Because of you&mdash;and by proving that <em>Fast 5</em> wasn&rsquo;t a fluke&mdash;we no longer have to be embarrassed about liking this franchise. And after that closing credits tease, count me as one of the people who thinks the seventh film can&rsquo;t come fast enough.</p>
<p>Joining the family,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
