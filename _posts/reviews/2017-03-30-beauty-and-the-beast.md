What a twisted and disconsolate world we live in. 

Unless you’ve been living under a rock, or have been magically transformed into some sort of sentient knick-knack that can only be found in a hallowed castle, _Beauty and the Beast_ has caused quite a stir for destroying all that is modest and pure in this world.

As marketing head, you of all people should be aware of the dramatic and irreversible damage that can be caused with the mere sight of two individuals of the same-sex embracing in what can only be described as the devil’s web of perversion. Once Director Bill Condon publicly announced that _Beauty and the Beast’s_ lovable goof, LeFou, would harbor toxic feelings towards his companion, Gaston, it should’ve been your job to swoop in and call an end to the madness.

But instead, what did you do? You doubled down. You ordered your cronies to _embrace_ this plot point and ruin any chance the next generation has of living a healthy, pious life.

Shame on you, Asad. _Shame on you_. You’re in the business of persuasion. You can actively influence the very direction of a film yet you decided to stand back and allow the horror to unfold. And because of you, the good people at Alabama’s Henagar Drive-In Theatre were forced to play their hand and cancel all screenings of the movie. Thank god they had the modesty of [_Fifty Shades Darker_](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2017/2/10/fifty-shades-darker.html) to fall back on.

As someone who works in marketing, I know that for a respectable company like Disney, nothing externally facing can get a go ahead without your two cents. Which is why I blame the use of pro-gay propaganda on your shoulders. Rather than stick to what made _Beauty and the Beast_ so special in the first place - a woman falling in love with a man-bear-wolf hybrid - you decided that making a political statement was more important than honouring a classic.

As the EVP of Marketing, you had no problem letting Josh Gad, the actor behind LeFou, state that the new addition to his character served as a “teachable” moment for anyone who still judges a book by its cover. What bullcrap. 

LeFou is merely Gaston’s “longtime companion”. Nothing more, nothing less. We’ve all been in a situation where we’ve respected the friendship of a fellow bro so much, we’ve broken out into song about how ravishing and captivating he is. Haven’t we?

Is it too much to ask to witness a movie nowadays without feeling the severe bite of liberalism?

Despite all of this, I still subjected myself to this film. I wanted to see just how far down the basket of deplorables went. I wanted to see what the future of Hollywood would be. I wanted to know if there was any speck of hope left. But what I saw in the final moments was sickening. I left the movie theater, dizzy, with knots in my stomach.

I couldn’t comprehend that I witnessed La Fou, a once adored and celebrated character, _dance_ with another man for two seconds. Two whole seconds! I counted. It was two seconds of pure, unadulterated hell.

I’m sure  all around the world jumped for joy at the sight of LeFou and his mystery one-night stand prancing around the castle for what seemed like hours. 

How am I supposed to be entranced into a world of magic, witchcraft, and spontaneous musical numbers performed by cutlery when I am too busy viewing the completely unrealistic scenario of two men falling in love?

What kind of message are you trying to say about Disney? How could Disney be so stupid to promote you to such a position? Please, Mr. Ayaz, I implore you, make things right in your next run. You have the authority to bring wholesomeness back to the cinema. 

Seeing as you’re the EVP of Marketing behind Disney’s other live-action remakes, including _Cinderella_, _Pete’s Dragon_, and _The Jungle Book_, you will undoubtedly assume the same position for the eventual releases of _Mulan_, _The Lion King_, and _Aladdin_. So, please, do the right thing.

I can only hope that my letter has shown you the error of your ways.
