<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><em><strong>Dear Richard Wild,</strong> Weather Consultant,</em></span></p>
<p>We all know how much Tim Burton loves ominous night skies, soul-splitting lightning, and dreamy fog sequences.&nbsp; His use of pathetic fallacy is iconic, setting up hyper-stylized worlds to support Johnny Depp&rsquo;s increasingly bizarre performances. And it&rsquo;s your job, Richard, to make sure no one &ndash; including God &ndash; rains on their parade. Until the reviews come out, anyway.</p>
<p>The good news is, you might be in the clear for <em>Dark Shadows</em>. The world you&rsquo;ve created is, refreshingly enough, darker in spirit than in design. For a film that&rsquo;s played for laughs, there are some pretty black turns. When Barnabas Collins, the film&rsquo;s charming-but-creepy vampire protagonist (played by Depp), breaks free of his 200-year entrapment into 1972, he savagely murders an entire construction crew. And that&rsquo;s just the start. The literal and metaphorical fogs in which he is lost actually come together to create a dreary mood of lost love.&nbsp; Well done.</p>

<p>But then the sun comes out.</p>
<p>Depp&rsquo;s Barnabas Collin&rsquo;s only treats sunlight as only a minor inconvenience, strolling about the town with minimal protection. Didn&rsquo;t you remind them that even humans today fear the sun&rsquo;s deadly cancer yielding rays?&nbsp; For a vampire, that fear should be tenfold. But maybe you all just couldn&rsquo;t resist getting out of the green screen studio for a few days.&nbsp; Fair enough.</p>
<p>The films does spend an awful lot of time indoors, setting up family dynamics that offer little payoff. Chlo&euml; Grace Mortez, Michelle Pfeiffer, and Jonny Lee Miller all seem game to play ball, but are never given a moment to shine. Sure, Helena Bonham Carter gets to make a scene-stealing sexual advance, but it&rsquo;s Eva Green, dressed in red, who really steals the show. Cue the rain and that scene would have been perfect. Next time, I guess. &nbsp;</p>
