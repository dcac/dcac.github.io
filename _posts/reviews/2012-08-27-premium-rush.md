<p>Who knew parked cars could be so dangerous? Cyclists, that&rsquo;s who. We who ride recumbent constantly fear illegally pulled-over obstacles and swinging door booby traps that clog the arteries of a city. It&rsquo;s about time someone found a way to translate the speed and hazards of the road into a full-tilt action feature. It&rsquo;s also one of the most exciting and kinetic action films of the year. I just hope you were paying attention.</p>
<p>On one hand, you and the real-life superhero&mdash;literally a man in tights&mdash;of <em>Premium Rush</em> seem like the yin and yang of transportation. Wilee (Joseph Gordon-Levitt) is named after the Coyote, but he&rsquo;s more like the Road Runner. As a fixed gear, steel frame, no brakes bicycle courier, he squeezes through the seams of the city and lives for a new rush every hour. By contrast, you block off huge sections of the street for a fleet of equipment trucks, craft cars and actor&rsquo;s trailers. Less sexy, sure, but at least it&rsquo;s safe. When Wilee unknowingly picks up a package worth a lot of money to the Chinese mafia, he&rsquo;s suddenly trying to outride good cops, bad cops, fellow couriers, and worst of all &ndash; New York City itself. Basically the same big honking mess you had to deal with every day.</p>
<p>In fact, you two have more in common than you might think. Figuring out where to put your vehicle becomes one of the most inventive conceits of co-writer and director David Koepp&rsquo;s storytelling. &ldquo;Wilee vision&rdquo;, as I&rsquo;ll call it, slows down reality and simulates the potential outcomes of various paths. Beyond being a fun way to add violence to a film with a relatively low body count, the visual trick helps the audience understand the risks of the road. That might double as a kick-ass public service announcement, but the primary purpose is to keep your pulse pounding. And it works.</p>
<p>Despite all the Google-map angles and chronology mashing, <em>Premium Rush </em>operates on a grounded, visceral level that feels authentic. Peddling and having to earn your speed is only part of it. Unlike the <em>Crank </em>films that take a lot of their energy from hand-held camera work, the steady and smooth cinematography as we fly down the streets makes me think you had much more than a small guerilla crew to maneuver. Yet the story is always on the move, so I&rsquo;m guessing those cars you parked didn&rsquo;t stick around for long. More work for you, but it&rsquo;s a lot more fun for us.</p>
<p>That said, I trust after working on this film that you realize the implications of your job. Putting a car in the wrong place at the wrong time can be deadly. But in this case, it&rsquo;s also entertaining as hell.</p>
<p>Ride on,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
