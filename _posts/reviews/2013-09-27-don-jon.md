<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><em><strong>Dear Simon &#8220;Avisari&#8221; Kangas</strong>, Pornography Consultant,</em></span></p>
<p>So pornhub.com, eh? Is that your go-to? I noticed the Brazzers.com logo got some awkward laughs of recognition from my audience, but more than once <em>Don Jon&rsquo;s</em> titular hero is seen lustfully punching &ldquo;porn hub&rdquo; into the keyboard before indulging in his thrice-daily (minimum) habit. This had to be your recommendation. There&rsquo;s no way that a sweet-natured, Hollywood heartthrob like Joseph-Gordon Levitt should be familiar with such a depraved portal. I mean, sure, he wrote, directed, and stars in the film, but clearly he needed an expert like you to understand a subject as marginal as <em>pornography</em>. Which means you obviously provided all the other porn-related insights as well, even if they were central to the making of this refreshingly funny and unflinching first feature.</p>
<p>Or maybe &ndash; just maybe &ndash; there&rsquo;s a part of Joseph-Gordon Levitt that wants the option to point his sticky finger at someone else if he&rsquo;s ever grilled about his inspirations.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s only natural. Even amongst men, it&rsquo;s pretty rare to discuss the dirty deed of masturbating to pornography. And when it comes to sharing that information with a romantic partner, forget it. Most women are bound to react like Scarlett Johansson&rsquo;s character, Barbara, when she finds out that her new boyfriend Jon prefers the pleasure of pixels over the pressure of real intimacy. I can understand her reaction, but on the other hand (you know which one), I also really appreciated that this movie &ldquo;went there&rdquo;, without treating the subject with a cold, sedated&mdash;yet strangely judgmental&mdash; approach like Steve McQueen&rsquo;s <em>Shame</em>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>To achieve this accessible and comedic tone, and no doubt distance himself from the character, Gordon-Levitt paints his protagonist in fairly broad (but aggressive) strokes. Jon&rsquo;s a womanizing, church-going, road-raging, gym rat who both looks and sounds like a character from <em>Jersey Shore</em>.&nbsp; His family dinners are loud and raucous, his evenings are spent picking-up &ldquo;dimes&rdquo; (women he considers a 10), and even after a night of sex, he can&rsquo;t help but sneak out of bed, boot up his Mac and crank one off.&nbsp; But it&rsquo;s the details of the ritual that are so amusing &ndash; how the sound of his computer turning on turns <em>him</em> on, the careful time spent browsing before committing to a video, and the unfortunate moments when a climax is ruined by the camera suddenly panning over a man. Only a true pornography enthusiast and professional consultant could be familiar with such vivid details. Right?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Frankly, I would have to be a sick man to say any of these (albeit exaggerated) obsessions resonated with me. So I won&rsquo;t. My wife reads these reviews from time to time.</p>
<p>But as far as movies for adults go &ndash; not &ldquo;adult movies&rdquo; &ndash; I can say pretty openly that I enjoyed this film. It&rsquo;s light without being fluff, and even has a few late but welcomed character surprises. Only <em>Don Jon</em>&rsquo;s low-budget production limitations seemed to bother me, like repeating framing and sequences over and over and over. Or was that just paying homage to porn tropes?</p>
<p>I wouldn&rsquo;t know.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Turning off,&nbsp;</p>
