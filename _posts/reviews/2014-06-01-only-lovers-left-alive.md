<p>Your credit at the end of <em>Only Lovers Left Alive </em>might be one of my favorites ever. &nbsp;I was scrambling to imagine what kind of person could not only have inspired Jim Jarmusch to create this emo-goth opus, but also spurred him into action. If your personal energy is anything at all like the characters and mood of the film, I can&rsquo;t imagine how such a resigned and forlorn person could play the role of motivator.&nbsp; Then again, maybe you&rsquo;re just an old-soul, a bleeding-heart romantic, and possess an equal measure of self-destructive pathos and straight-faced sense of humour.</p>
<p>Or maybe you&rsquo;re actually a centuries-old vampire.</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s go with the latter.</p>
<p>If this is the case, you must first admit that no mortal actor is more naturally equipped to play a classic bloodsucker than Tilda Swinton. She didn&rsquo;t even have to open her mouth before I believed fully and completely in her portrayal of Eve. From her first moment onscreen, in that beautiful sequence where she lies lifeless on a Victorian-style bed with the camera twisting backwards, the despairing tone of the film is unmistakable. The score by SQ&Uuml;RL certainly helps, with its reverberating guitar chords that claw under your skin. But there&rsquo;s a lively spirit throughout, too, buoyed by deadpan one-liners and the occasional blood popsicles. The approach is refreshing in a tired genre: vampires who aren&rsquo;t suave or sweaty, but hauntingly cool.</p>
<p>They&rsquo;re musical geniuses, too&mdash;at least in the case of Tom Hiddleston&rsquo;s Adam (a.k.a. Jared Leto&rsquo;s doppleganger). He&rsquo;s your prototypical burnt-out rock star, energized only when driving past Jack White&rsquo;s childhood home or reminiscing about how he gave Schubert the adagio for his quintet. Not be outdone is John Hurt as the eldest vamp, who takes credit for Shakespeare&rsquo;s biggest hits.</p>
<p>These references to classic art influenced by outside sources could be an homage to you, since Jarmusch has previously credited you as a story consultant on <em>Ghost Dog</em>, a production &ldquo;troubleshooter&rdquo; on <em>Down By Law,</em> and even as his inspiration for <em>Broken Flowers.</em> Not to mention that you were the &ldquo;Girl with Hat&rdquo; in his 1984 breakout indie film <em>Stranger Than Paradise</em>. No wonder you kept egging him on to make this film; he&rsquo;s helping to write your legacy.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Which leads me to believe you&rsquo;re most like the character of Ava, who is this film&rsquo;s real lifeblood. Sure she&rsquo;s a comically spoiled minx, rendered perfectly by Mia Wasikoswka, but she&rsquo;s also responsible for most of the story&rsquo;s action. Her drifting attention span and stubbornness is a perfect foil to the laconic lovers, and she&rsquo;s impossible not to adore. Even for a tormented independent artist.</p>
<p>Thanks goodness you both helped push this film over the top.</p>
<p>Inspired and instigated,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
