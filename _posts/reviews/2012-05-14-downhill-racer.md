<p>When a star rises so fast, so far, there&rsquo;s sometimes nowhere left to go but down. And in this particular race to the bottom, you certainly won. From three-time Academy Award nominee at age 25, to production assistant at age 30? <em>Downhill Racer</em>, indeed.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m kidding, of course. I understand it was a nicety and by no means a necessity that you recopied script pages and wardrobe-shopped for Robert Redford&rsquo;s 1969 passion project. Luckily, the Criterion Collection&rsquo;s restored copy of this forgotten classic has done a great job giving you, and the film itself, some well deserved credit after the film first stumbled and crashed on its release. Yet the premise must have struck a chord with you. So down you went. On to the film set. To lend a hand. Like a good friend.</p>
<p>You had some help. Director Michael Ritchie does a brilliant job of giving the audience a first-person perspective of the breakneck adventures of downhill skiing. But by all accounts in the DVD extras, it was Redford&rsquo;s personal determination that got the film made. For your sake, however, I hope Redford was nothing like the film&rsquo;s arrogant and bullish hero: abundant with talent and indulged by those around him by the promise of fame, fortune, and glory.</p>
<p>I imagine you instead being spirited away by his passion (and possibly his good looks) to create a film about the mantra of winning at all costs. And, if that was the case, maybe you would have been smarter to hitch your horse to <em>Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid</em>, which came out the same year. The cliffs he jumped off in that one were much sexier to audiences.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, Roger Ebert would later call it &ldquo;the best movie ever made about sports&rdquo;, but his young thumbs weren&rsquo;t yet helping direct the taste of the masses. So tell me, what&rsquo;s the big mystery about why this film died?</p>
<p>And actually, while you&rsquo;re at it&hellip;</p>
<p>Oh, never mind.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
