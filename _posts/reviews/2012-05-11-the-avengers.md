<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><em><strong>Dear Jared Young, Age 12, </strong>Future Reviewer of The Avengers,</em></span></p>
<p>Tell me, Jared: how am I supposed to compose a fair review of a movie that seems &ndash; from start to finish, in tone and content, in the quiet beats between loud explosions and the loud beatings between quiet expositions &ndash; plucked directly from your twelve year-old brain? And, more than that, treats your Slurpee-induced reveries with such respect, such <em>veneration</em>?&nbsp;</p>
<p>I can&rsquo;t.</p>
<p>In about ten years you&rsquo;ll discover John Updike and he&rsquo;ll offer some germane advice on this topic. In developing a series of guidelines that would define his criticism, he warned: &ldquo;Do not accept for review a book you are predisposed to dislike, or committed by friendship to like. Do not imagine yourself a caretaker of any tradition, an enforcer of any party standards, a warrior in an ideological battle, a corrections officer of any kind.&rdquo;</p>
<p>You might not feel like a caretaker of tradition right now, but, when you hit your thirties, you&rsquo;ll find that you spend most of your free time caretaking the tradition of being twelve years-old. And though I&rsquo;m not committed by friendship to like <em>The Avengers</em>, I am committed to <em>you</em>, twelve-year-old me &ndash; to seeking those unconditional, uncorrupted thrills that conjure you out the past &ndash; and that makes it impossible for me to apply the sort of ideological objectivity that Updike argues is essential to the critic&rsquo;s trade. &nbsp;</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll find, as you get older, that it&rsquo;s easy to be cynical about almost everything&mdash;movies like<em> The Avengers</em>, in particular. Sure, the characters are commodities, pawns in the great big box office Ponzi scheme. But what does the context matter to you, childhood self? You don&rsquo;t care about the marketing budget or the promotional tie-ins or the per-screen averages. What matters most to you are the witty physics of the comic book world, the ecstasy of two opposing forces coming colorfully together: Thor dropping Mjolnir onto Cap&rsquo;s vibranium shield, Iron Man&rsquo;s mid-air suit-up, Loki&rsquo;s ill-planned sermon to the Hulk (who, with a single punch, forgives all of Ang Lee and Edward Norton&rsquo;s well-meant missteps). What matters to you is what&rsquo;s onscreen, and, from this future vantage point, I assure you that what&rsquo;s onscreen will exceed your expectations.</p>
<p>We begin with an introduction to that most ineffable of MacGuffins: the Cosmic Cube (renamed, here, The Tesseract), which leads, of course, to dimensional portals, mind control, and alien invasions. The usual stuff. But it&rsquo;s not just the spectacle of computer effects that brings to life the world of the comics (they&rsquo;ve come a long way since the liquid metal Terminator you&rsquo;re currently so enamored of); it&rsquo;s the miraculous feat of screenwriting that divides time equally between all six protagonists, giving each their moment of bombastic heroism, each their moment of existential worry; it&rsquo;s the characters you love brought brilliantly to life by actors who take seriously the responsibility of living up to a half-century&#8217;s-worth of character notes; it&rsquo;s the pure pop expression of the superhero myth, which, in the Marvel Universe, was never a fantasy about control, but about a lack of it. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I have some bad news, me. You&rsquo;re soon going to learn that the world is a much more complicated place than you think. You&rsquo;ve been raised to have faith in the credo that all things are possible, and that&rsquo;s a fine thing to believe, but passing time will prove it to be a figurative statement.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not a matter of cynicism or optimism. It&rsquo;s a matter of knowledge. You&rsquo;re going to gain it. And sometimes knowledge sucks.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But I have some good news, too. Despite everything that&rsquo;s going to happen between now and now &ndash; all the disappointments, all the sad insights into the way the world really works, all the things you once thought possible so clearly revealed to be just the opposite &ndash; you have this one great thing to look forward to: a guy named Joss Whedon is going to make an <em>Avengers</em> movie, and he&rsquo;s going to make it just for you.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>You, Age 32</p>
