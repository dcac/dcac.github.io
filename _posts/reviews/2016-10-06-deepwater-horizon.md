Making a big budget movie about the mess in U.S. history is risky business. For one, you’re leaving the door wide-open for smart-ass critics to compare one (potential) disaster with another. James Cameron famously tempted that fate before releasinghis wildly over-budget _Titanic_. He, of course, was rewarded both [critically and commercially](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/4/20/titanic-3d.html) for his audacity. _Titanic_’s fate couldn’t be more different than the event it depicted. 

_Deepwater Horizon_ will also diverge from its famous oil spill, but in a very different way: film will quietly disappear without having left much of a mark

The same obviously can’t be said of the biggest environmental disaster in U.S. history. Back in 2010, it was simply referred to as the “BP oil spill”. Week after week, there seemed to be no end in sight for the environmental catastrophe. Hundreds of millions of gallons of oil blew out from the sea-floor after an off-shore drilling unit exploded, claiming 11lives. And it’s in this initial fiery chaos that Peter Berg focuses his lens. 

 to people like you to clean up his sloppy visual storytelling. Once again we are reminded that, as hard as Berg tries, Michael Bay he is not. 

Digging for oil is dirty business. You can indulge that grit by giving your characters a romantic glow amid the mud (Michael Bay’s _Armageddon_) or cast a cold eye on crude oil for a disturbing, yet equally beautiful effect (P.T. Anderson’s _There Will Be Blood_). What you should _not_ do is make an already muddy situation worse by obstructing the image in key moments and undercutting human emotion with glaringly obvious visual effects.

Normally, a person like you is hired to cover these seams. But while the film does a workman-like job  first half setting the stage and laying down the stakes with simple metaphors, I found myself strangely disengaged when it mattered most. And frankly, it was your fault.

There is a moment of sacrifice when a person falls to their fate from an oil rig. Compare it to the finale of _Backdraft_ – also co-starring Kurt Russel – where the impact of the body hitting the steel beams is . Of course in 1991, that was achieved with real fire and a life-like dummy. In 2016, it’s VFX artists like you that crunch the numbers to produce a moment. But in an error as old as computer graphics themselves, are weightless and emotionally inconsequential. Detrimental, in fact. Especially for a film that’s already treading water. There’s a similar shot in _Titanic_ of a man tumbling off the sinking ship and spinning as he hits a guard rail. It looked mawkishly fake even at the time, but luckily the rest of the drama held that story afloat. 

By contrast, there’s a moment in _Deepwater Horizon_ when Russell’s character needs to remove an awfully large shard of glass from his bare foot. That scene provided me with more recoil and emotional investment than anything else in the film. The focus was clean and clear, even if the subject was and disgusting. You may have been equally involved here, in which case congrats. But it’s that principle that was missing from the rest of the film – up to and including the explosion rising up through the oil tower. It’s 2016 – we just can’t accept sloppy effects. Even in a movie that’s all about messiness and sloppy choices.
