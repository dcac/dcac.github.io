<p><em><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Jacob J. Yoo</strong>, Screenplay Translator,</span></em></p>
<p>Hollywood has a wonderful tradition of attracting the world&rsquo;s biggest film stars. The biggest proof has to be Arnold Schwarzenegger, despite an incredibly awkward <a href="/letters/tag/early-arnold">early career</a> and this new, strange, career twilight phase you&rsquo;re a party to. But he&rsquo;s far from alone. In fact, <em>The Last Stand </em>is equally notable for being South Korean genre specialist Kim Jee-woon&rsquo;s English language directorial debut, despite his not speaking any English. So the task fell to you to make sure nothing was lost in the translation of this all-American themed action-western adventure that essentially pits the Terminator against <em>The Good, The Bad and the Weird</em>. The result is a big messy mash-up that harnesses awkward charm to meet entertaining ends.</p>
<p>The casting alone personifies the film&rsquo;s warm embrace of the bizarre. Schwarzenegger plays a small town sheriff enjoying the quiet life after a bloody drug bust went sour in Los Angeles. His deputy is played by the always enjoyable Luis Guzm&aacute;n, who can out-funny talk almost anyone who calls English a second language. That is, until Peter Stormare graces the town with his obscure accent and dubious plan to smuggle (read: violently shuttle) a Mexican drug lord across the border. Schwarzenegger must, therefore, round up a rag-tag of heroes that includes ex-solider and current jail-house lock-up Rodrigo Santoro, who boasts the sexiest ill-command of English in the bunch. The film might as well include the subtitle <em>In the Land of Funny Accents</em>, but that probably wouldn&rsquo;t sell. Instead,<em> </em>the posters make a big deal of Johnny Knoxville&rsquo;s presence, but your script is much less interested why his character is included, beyond a nominal plot purpose at the end.</p>
<p>Ironically, a film like this may never have been designed for American audiences. A lot of clumsy nuance can be forgiven when subtitles are slapped over a performance. If the story works, the action is convincing, and the pacing feels right, a lot of nitpicking would be lost on foreign audiences (that ever-growing box office market). And to that end, the film gets a lot of things right. The early escape sequence in Las Vegas is impressive, the characters are given time to process and react to what&rsquo;s happening, and a number of the action sequences (namely the cat-and-mouse chase in the cornfields) feel inspired. All of these elements play well to the genre, and feel like they&rsquo;re working on an appropriately exciting, but not wildly over-the-top scale. Well, at least by American movie standards.</p>
<p>For that reason, I&rsquo;d say you did a pretty good job. The director obviously understands the universal film language of shooting underdog action picture. Even if the rest of production is working from a very basic translation.</p>
