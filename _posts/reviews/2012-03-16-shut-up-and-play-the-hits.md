Are times tough? No, don't think so. But I think I know why you took this seemingly beneath you gig for the concert film _Shut Up and Play the Hits--_to have a first-class view of a concert destined to go down as a classic.

Well, I hope you enjoyed it. Being LCD Soundsystem's last performance ever, it sure seemed--and sounded--pretty great. And the footage you and your co-cameramen got was surprisingly intimate, considering the huge crowd filling out Madison Square Gardens. Or so I assume; shots conveying the full scale of the show, both on stage and off, were strangely lacking.

Were you involved in the footage shot the next day, following frontman James Murphy around New York as he tried to decide on the next chapter of his life? I'm guessing no - these had a staginess and pretension that even your craziest fictional films avoid.

But man, that show rocked.
