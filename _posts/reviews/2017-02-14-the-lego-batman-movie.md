One of the standouts of 2014’s _The LEGO Movie_ was the uber-catchy original song by Tegan and Sara ft. The Lonely Island, _Everything is Awesome_. Not to be outdone by a bunch of moody twins and a trio of losers, you tapped into your inner Batman and grumbled out a hit of your own: Who’s the (Bat)Man.

Of course, I don’t really think Tegan and Sara are moody twins nor Lonely Island, losers, I was just inspired by the rock ‘n’ roll personality of _Who’s the (Bat)Man_. Your song is essentially _Everything is Awesome_, but the everything is replaced with Batman and that’s perfectly acceptable because Batman _is_ awesome and so is _The LEGO Batman Movie._

_The LEGO Batman Movie_ is the widely anticipated spin-off for _The LEGO Movie_’s standout character, Batman; a self-absorbed narcissist who is the product of every fan’s obsession with him. He’s essentially Christopher Nolan’s husky voiced Dark Knight and _How It Should Have Ended_’s post-credit Batman. If you’re not familiar with the latter, look it up and see the similarities for yourself. 

LEGO Batman is well aware that he’s the moneymaker for DC Comics and he revels in the fact. He’s a celebrity, both as Bruce Wayne and Batman. He’s prone to talking about his chiseled abs and his ability to take down villains without breaking a sweat. He’s the plastic manifestation of pop-culture’s obsession with superheroes which is why he might be the most compelling caped crusader to ever grace the big screen.

_The LEGO Batman Movie_ could have been whatever it wanted to be and it chose to be an homage to the character’s history across film, TV, and comics. This film is a quirky and hilarious treat for moviegoers of all ages. The children who go to see it will absolutely love the potty-mouthed humour while some of the older crowd will appreciate all the nods to Batman’s past. Although, I would be lying if I didn’t admit that The Joker rubbing his butt on the Batmobile and calling it the ‘buttmobile’ cracked me the hell up.

One instance in which _The LEGO Batman Movie_ absolutely nails what it is to be a lifelong Batman fan comes in the opener where The Joker is introducing his team of supervillains. He names off the usual subjects like Catwoman, The Riddler, and Bane, but continues to go down the list to even the most obscure and laughable villains such as Eraser, Crazy Quilt, and Condiment King. The scene works on many levels but the kicker was the moment my girlfriend leaned over and asked, “are those all real names?” to which my answer was a gleeful “_yes”_.

Despite all the meta moments and references to butts, there is a genuinely heartfelt story in _The LEGO Batman Movie_ that takes Batman through a journey of self-discovery. He actually grows as a character which is the biggest critique against the live-action DC films. It makes me wonder how a movie about plastic toys can draw out more emotion than their live-action counterparts. LEGO Batman is actively saving DC’s ass, which only helps add to his over-the-top persona. 

Now more than ever I realize just how important _The LEGO Batman Movie_ really is. Eight decades is a long time to be The Man, yet Batman continues to evolve and stay at the top of his league. Batman has already secured his spot as the _It_ superhero for the foreseeable future. Sure, people would love to fly around Metropolis like Superman, but it wouldn’t compare to the gravitas that comes with being The Dark Knight. 

Even though _The LEGO Batman Movie_ pokes fun at the character, it does him an even greater service by reminding us about all the times Batman has been awesome.

So, if I may quote some of your lyrics:

Who has the coolest gadgets? 

Who has the tricked out ride? 

Who does the sickest backflips? 

Who's the manliest man?

You better believe it’s the Batman.
