Do you have the time, to listen to me whine  
About the way this film's stuck in '99?  
Pie is one those, melodramatic sequels  
Neurotic with a tone of doubt about it.

Sometimes I give them a free pass  
Sometimes my mind enjoys this crap  
But the films are adding up  
What's next, three girls and a cup?  
Am I just paranoid  
or is this old? 

I went to the show  
To see how far they'd go  
There's not a lack of sex  
Or skin to go 'round.  
Jim sure looked sore  
When squishing his junk for  
A trick that Judd Apatow  
Wishes he'd known.

It's time to give up on this cast  
It's time to let the past be past  
These stars are all washed up  
But the crowds keep showing up  
This franchise should be done  
But it goes on.

Grasping for greenbacks  
It's a modest comeback.
