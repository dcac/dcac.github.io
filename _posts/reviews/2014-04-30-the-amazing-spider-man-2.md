<p>Congratulations on creating something of a cohesive narrative out of this mess. I can only imagine the footage you sifted through in order to create a film of great imagination (and even greater plot holes). Director Marc Webb clearly set his sights on the tween-market, assuming that a generation raised on tweets and snapchat would appreciate shiny distraction over plot and character development.</p>
<p>Let me see if I can make sense of the story you were trying to piece together:</p>
<p>The <em>Amazing Spider-Man 2</em> opens with a vague introduction of what happened to Peter Parker&#8217;s parents&mdash;and with that bit of exposition out of the way, we quickly barrel into proper Spidey hijinks: an Eastern-European loon has a load of nuclear bits and bobs in a truck! Will no one stop the Eastern-European loon! (The real baddie here seems to be the immigration office: I&#8217;m surprised at the number of wicked Nazi scientists and mad Russians they let into the country; can&rsquo;t they tell from the accent, the cackle, and the deranged facial expressions that these guys are up to no good?)</p>
<p>While Spider-Man destroys half of the NYPD&#8217;s patrol cars in the process of stopping him, his lovely lady, Gwen, is making a poignant speech at their graduation, which he only just manages to attend.</p>
<p>Gwen isn&#8217;t Peter&#8217;s lovely lady for long though. Guilt over her dead father&#8217;s wishes (to keep her out of harm&#8217;s way) leads to the death of their relationship and the beginning of their epic love story.</p>
<p>Will they get back together? Won&#8217;t they? Wait; why won&#8217;t they again? The movie seems to lose track of this itself, but that&#8217;s understandable, see poor Spidey has a lot on his plate. If the city isn&#8217;t suffering a major electrical problem, random planes aren&#8217;t crashing, an evil corporation isn&#8217;t doing evil things, and no one&#8217;s after Spider-Man&#8217;s blood, then Gwen&#8217;s off to Oxford University! Just as one storyline seems to build momentum, another web-stream of plot shoots off in the opposite direction.</p>
<p>Spidey does his best, swinging here and there, helping out where he can&mdash;especially little kids who need big hugs and empty remarks. Interspersed with these empty remarks, we&#8217;re introduced to the villains&#8230;<em>all</em> of the villains. Besides the aforementioned Soviet Block Baddie, there&rsquo;s Max Dillon, the maligned and ignored electrical engineer, whose finest work is stolen by Oscorp right before he&rsquo;s involved in a major work accident involving electrical eels. He becomes Octo, a electrical blue phantom, who&#8217;s shoved in the basement with a Nazi scientist until the plot requires him later. Then there&rsquo;s Harry Osborne, heir to the Oscorp conglomerate, who just happens to be Peter Parker&#8217;s best friend and is now dying of the same nasty lizard disease that killed his father. (Therefore he needs Spider-Man blood.) If that wasn&#8217;t good enough for you there&#8217;s that nasty Oscorp corporation prepared to do anything to topple Harry, their newly appointed Chairman, and keep their evil experimenting on the down-low.</p>
<p>While all of this villainous stuff is percolating, Peter&nbsp; is struggling to figure out why he was abandoned by his parents,&nbsp; his relationship with Gwen, and&mdash;oh, did I forget to mention how Aunt May is studying to become a nurse to help save money for Peter to go to college?</p>
<p>How you were able to cut this all together, I don&rsquo;t know. The film swings wildly from plotline to plotline like Spider-Man crossing the city on his webs. And when it comes to resolving any of them, it turns out that a baddie&#8217;s real identity can be uncovered in a casual chat in the elevator, and the disappearance of your parents can be solved by figuring out that they used the subway.</p>
<p>Logic isn&#8217;t this movie&#8217;s strong point. Unfortunately, logic &ndash; both spatial and narrative &ndash; is the cornerstone of your profession.</p>
<p>So kudos, Pietro, for turning it into something that makes any sort of sense whatsoever.</p>
