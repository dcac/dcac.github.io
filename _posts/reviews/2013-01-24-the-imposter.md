<p><em><strong style="font-size:130%;">Dear Adam O&#8217;Brian, </strong><span style="font-size:130%;">Actor,</span></em></p>
<p>Congratulations. You had me fooled.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not exactly sure when I realized that Fr&eacute;d&eacute;ric Boudin wasn&rsquo;t playing himself in most of the re-enactment sections of <em>The Imposter</em>, but it took me a little while. We have plenty of time to examine his face in the interview segments, but a low-hanging ball cap and hoodie did a lot to curb my questions. Was this intentional on the filmmaker&rsquo;s part? Of course! From an audience perspective, Boudin&rsquo;s willingness to participate in the interview segments makes it conceivable he would simply play himself. But more importantly, this subtle deception helps us empathize with the film&rsquo;s victims.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s this type of dynamic storytelling that is reason I want to convince &ndash; not fool &ndash; people to see this film.</p>
<p>The premise of this documentary seems rather improbable. A Frenchman convinces a Texas family that he is the 13-year-old son who disapeared three years earlier.&nbsp; The stranger is not, however, just some lookalike who shows up on their doorstep one day. Fr&eacute;dric Boudin is flown from overseas to &ldquo;rejoin&rdquo; this family. It&rsquo;s a ticking time bomb for an emotional meltdown, ratcheted up with stark, beautiful images and blunt first-person confessions. But can we really trust a narrator who paints himself to be a desperate master of deception?&nbsp; These questions become key, especially during a major twist that had me gasp out loud.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a treat to discover a documentary this riveting. Director Bart Layton has a handle on pacing that would be the envy of most genre filmmakers.&nbsp; <em>The Imposter</em> is the latest example of how well this format can work outside of the typical activist and education ghetto the public too often lumps it in with. And for you, I&rsquo;m sure a gig&rsquo;s a gig, but in the back of your mind you must have been thinking that no actor gets their &ldquo;big break&rdquo; in a documentary. But consider this:</p>
<p>There are many schools of thought as to what constitutes great acting.&nbsp; Some say it&rsquo;s an art of illusion, others say self-revelation. And you can now attach your name to a film that accomplishes both.</p>
<p>Honestly impressed,&nbsp;</p>
