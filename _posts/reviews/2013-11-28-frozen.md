When it comes to power couples on Broadway, you and your husband Robert Lopez are certainly the toast of the town. It makes sense that he, the two-time Tony award-winner for _Avenue Q_ and _The Book of Mormon_, and you, with celebrated work on _Winnie the Pooh_ and the _Finding Nemo_ musical, would be hired to create the music for a film like _Frozen_. It also sounds a lot like, well, a Disney fairy tale. Which is only appropriate, I suppose, for an animated film that is a triumphant return-to-form for the storied company.

From the first musical notes, which evoke the tribal hymns of _The Lion King_, _Frozen_ is warmly reminiscent of Disney's animated classics. Like _The Little Mermaid_, it's inspired by a Hans Christian Anderson story. It borrows elements from the _Sleeping Beauty _storyline. The world-building uses _Beauty and the Beast_'s approach to anthropomorphism, where magic can make objects talk but not animals - in this case, an aloof and ever optimistic snowman, Olaf (Josh Gadd), who also happens to be the best comic relief since Robin Williams' Genie in _Aladdin_. One sequence with a snow monster even feels like it's embracing stop-motion animation techniques from that beloved black sheep of the Disney family, _The Nightmare Before Christmas_. Yet even with all these comparisons, _Frozen_ never feels derivative or parodical. Instead - and thanks to your music - it's exactly what Disney fans have been waiting for.

The opening song "Frozen Heart" introduces us to the winter kingdom of Arendelle, with male labourers carving out blocks of ice to the rhythm of their deep baritone chants (inspired, no doubt, by _Les Miserables_ show-opener "Look Down"). You then do a wonderful job of pushing the story along through the time-ellipsing heartbreaker "Do You Want to Build a Snowman?", which transitions our child characters to their adult selves. The hopeful longing continues in the dueling performance of "For the First Time in Forever", sung between two perspectives of sisters Anna (Kristen Bell) and Else (Idina Menzel). This is where even more of your eccentricities are allowed to shine through, with lyrics like "I don't know if I'm elated or gassy, but I'm somewhere in that zone". You also do something novel for Disney by having the characters speak in the repetitive and emphatic verbiage of teenage girls. Take this in stanza, for example:

_There'll be actual real live people_  
_It'll be totally strange_  
_But wow, am I so ready for this change._

The songs just keep getting better, from the quirky sing-a-long "Love is an Open Door" to the slightly absurd but wonderfully dippy "Summer Song". Sure, the film doesn't have 90s-era Celine Dion or Elton John-esque power ballad, but that actually feels appropriate for a film that ultimately aims to subvert both story and song conventions whenever possible. You obviously wanted to put some distance between yourself and your predecessors Howard Ashman and Alan Menken. It works, and the film succeeds as a result.

So in that spirit, here's hoping you and your husband can keep working in such "sync-ro-ni-city" and continue to finish each others… sandwiches.
