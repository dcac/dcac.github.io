<p style="text-align:center;">Part of <em>Dear Cast and Crew</em>&#8217;s <a href="/events/2013/9/12/mockbuster-series.html">Mockbusters Series</a></p>
<p>I can&#8217;t help but wonder, Graham, if you were familiar with the &#8216;mockbuster&#8217; genre prior to being cast in <em>Atlantic Rim</em>. It certainly is a clever word, evoking memories of such classic satires as <em>Airplane</em> and <em>The Naked Gun</em>. Heck, perhaps your agent even pitched this project to you as a sharp-witted, Zucker Brothers-style parody of this summer&rsquo;s blockbuster <a href="/letters/2013/7/11/pacific-rim.html"><em>Pacific Rim</em>.</a></p>
<p>Regardless of whatever duplicitous means were employed to bring you on board, the production&#8217;s true nature must have come as quite a shock. I don&#8217;t want to come off as needlessly antagonistic, so I won&#8217;t ask what it was like for you, a former Oscar-nominated actor, to realize that you were starring in the type of low-budget rip-off that exists solely to piggyback off the success of a bigger hit (or to trick people into purchasing what they think is the real McCoy). But believe me when I say this, man: you are far, far and away the best thing about <em>Atlantic Rim</em>.</p>
<p>I&#8217;ve thought long and hard about how best to describe your performance. But even now, days after viewing the &ldquo;film,&rdquo; I can&rsquo;t find the words. Your demeanor onscreen seems to suggest that you find the material completely unworthy of your time (and rightly so), yet somehow you&#8217;re simultaneously giving it your very all. In other words, it seems as if you care, but also don&#8217;t care at all. This duality makes your character, a fairly stock military officer, absolutely fascinating to watch.</p>
<p>In nearly every scene you look as if you&#8217;d rather be somewhere else (possibly throttling your agent), and you bark out your lame-brained dialogue (&#8220;Pipe down, guys!&#8221;) with little discernible enthusiasm. But there&#8217;s a something indefinable behind your eyes that keeps your character, against all odds (and, boy, are there some long odds), weirdly compelling.</p>
<p>If only your fellow actors had decided to follow in your footsteps, then <em>Atlantic Rim</em> might have been a far more tolerable experience. Clearly they were aware of the film&#8217;s quality (or lack thereof), and instead of playing it straight we have to watch them struggling to hide smiles; a sort of unpleasant self-awareness that, in David Chokachi&#8217;s case, makes the audience curse their ability to both see and hear (you must have showed some truly admirable restraint while interacting with him on the set&mdash;unless there are some choke slam/backhanding incidents that have yet to be made public).</p>
<p>Unfortunately, the filmmakers seemed oblivious to the miraculous quality of your performance, and they drop the ball in a <em>big</em> way in the third act. For a film that so shamelessly apes <em>Pacific Rim</em>&#8217;s core concepts &ndash; aquatic monsters rising to wreak havoc on the surface world, experimental robots with a neurological link to their military pilots (or in Chokachi&#8217;s case, a neurological link to alcoholic frat-boy douchebags) &ndash; the one thing writer <a href="/letters/2013/7/17/sharknado.html">Thunder Levin</a> decided to steer clear from was having the leader of the operation &ndash; your character &ndash; &nbsp;suit up to take part in the climatic final battle. A poor choice, I think, especially since your character is given precious little to do in the previous hour of the movie besides staring at computer monitors and yelling at people wearing eye patches.</p>
<p>If only you <em>had</em> been allowed to take part in the movie&#8217;s climax, maybe then the ten-minute-long &#8220;spectacle&#8221; of Rock-&#8216;Em Sock-&lsquo;Em Robots zipping through the air and swatting at a dragon with what appear to be giant stop signs might have gained some degree of excitement or emotion or humor.</p>
<p>And by &ldquo;some&rdquo; I mean &ldquo;any.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Respectfully yours,</p>
<p>Kelan</p>
