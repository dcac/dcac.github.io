<p><em style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Jack McKenna,</strong> DGA Trainee,</em></p>
<p>According to the Director&rsquo;s Guild of America&rsquo;s <a href="http://www.dgatrainingprogram.org/">website</a>, the assistant director trainee program you participated in is &ldquo;designed to provide opportunities for a limited number of individuals to become Assistant Directors,&rdquo; and comprises of &ldquo;a rotation system [that] places trainees on the sets of various features, television series, and commercials.&rdquo;</p>
<p>So, Jack&mdash;what did you learn on the set of Liam Neeson&rsquo;s latest throat-punching action-thriller <em>Non-Stop</em>?</p>
<p>Your first lesson appears to have been on the finer points of establishing mood; specifically, the psychological mood of a former cop turned renegade air marshal (as they do). All the essentials are present in the opening scenes of the film: grimy close-ups of cigarettes being sucked and stubbed out, spastic hand-held shots during moments of calm (you know, because even when he&rsquo;s calm, he&rsquo;s <em>on the edge!</em>). It&rsquo;s also vital that you get the framing right when he reaches for his secret bottle of booze (always dark liquor; the clear stuff doesn&rsquo;t have the same despairing screen presence), and director Jaume Collet-Serra, as you no doubt observed, keeps things appropriately tight. He even had Neeson pause and stare at the bottle right before tipping it back. You know, because he&rsquo;s reluctant. They call this &ldquo;complexity of character.&rdquo; You might be a few years away from directing actors &ndash; probably after you assist a few <a href="/letters/2013/3/8/oz-the-great-and-powerful.html">second-unit assistant directors</a> &ndash; but it&rsquo;s important to pay attention to these small details.</p>
<p>I hope you were taking notes, too, when the action moves onto the plane. When trapped in such a relatively small space, most filmmakers might do the obvious thing and exaggerate that sense of claustrophobia with long lenses and high-contrast lighting. Maybe bring back a bit of that shaky-cam from earlier. But it takes some ambition to draw the camera outside the plane to pan across the exterior windows for a series of reaction shots from the passengers. It&rsquo;s even a bit daring to open up the space of the cabin with a free-floating camera that glides unobstructed over the tops of the seats. This jetliner, as a result, feels as wide open as a football field (an apt metaphor, don&rsquo;t you think?&mdash;what with all the tackling that ensues).</p>
<p>This operatic use of the camera is the most obvious clue that <em>Non-Stop</em> aspires to be, in style and substance, a Hitchcockian locked-room mystery. And the biggest surprise might be that it doesn&rsquo;t entirely fail. For a while, the plot uncoils with mechanical precision; a anonymous terrorist dictates that every twenty minutes a passenger will die. And so they do, mostly in clever ways. But with Liam Neeson in the lead, throats <em>must</em> be punched, daughters <em>must </em>be avenged. How to balance these two juggernauts of narrative energy? How to marry the action and the suspense?</p>
<p>The answer, in this case, is to flagellate your fun premise with a little bit of real-world socio-political commentary.</p>
<p>And here, Jack, is where you learned your biggest lesson on the set of <em>Non-Stop</em>: that there&rsquo;s nothing in our cultural memory so sacred that Hollywood can&rsquo;t exploit if for gain. Even if the gain is something as innocuous as the film&rsquo;s big reveal, when the real hijacker suddenly appears and does what all lame movie villains do: gives a speech that explains everything and means nothing.</p>
<p>But don&rsquo;t feel bad. You&rsquo;re still learning. Even the <a href="/letters/2012/5/18/battleship.html">most seasoned assistant director</a> could have done little to fix such a fundamental story flaw. I just hope you read the <a href="http://www.dgatrainingprogram.org/index.php?mnu=3">fine print</a> on your internship agreement: &ldquo;Acceptance into the program is not a guarantee of graduation.&rdquo; Remember what you learned while shooting the first 90 minutes out of 107. Forget everything else.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jared</p>
