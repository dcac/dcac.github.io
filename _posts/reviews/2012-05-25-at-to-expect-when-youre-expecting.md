<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><em><strong>Dear Heather Hach,</strong> Co-Screenwriter,</em></span></p>
<p>I have no doubt that you were qualified to write the screen adaptation of <em>What to Expect When You&rsquo;re Expecting</em>. You&rsquo;ve twice experienced the miracle of childbirth and surely possess the sort of arcane knowledge that the best-selling pregnancy guide, first published in 1984, has provided to a generation of expectant moms. I&rsquo;ll even concede that the task assigned to you and co-writer Shauna Cross was near-impossible: adapt an instructional non-fiction health manual into a Hollywood film big enough to accommodate any number of ascending B-list and declining A-list stars.</p>
<p>So, what happened?</p>
<p>The approach you took was smart: create a sort of Altman-esque tapestry of braided narratives, each focused on a unique element of the pregnancy experience&mdash;like <em>Nashville</em>, but marching towards the delivery room instead of a political rally. Sadly, what we&rsquo;re left with is more <em>New Year&rsquo;s Eve</em> than <em>Short Cuts</em>.</p>
<p>San Francisco is the setting. Elizabeth Banks, Jennifer Lopez, Cameron Diaz, and Anna Kendrick are the soon-to-be moms. The guy from <em>Glee</em> and the Air Marshal from <em>Bridesmaids</em> are the patently uninteresting husbands. The director is Kirk Jones, and he handles every scene with the same pop-music gentility, which sometimes works (as during the Ethiopian adoption ceremony) and often doesn&rsquo;t (as during the cruelly interminable lead-up to a miscarriage diagnosis). The timing and telemetry is lifted directly from every romantic comedy released over the last twenty years, and the result is something that seems beyond clich&eacute;. It&rsquo;s like one of those movie scene mash-ups you might find on YouTube. But less clever.</p>
<p>You know, it&rsquo;s not really fair of me to bring up Robert Altman. I was just trying to make myself sound smart. I can&rsquo;t blame you for not achieving what you didn&rsquo;t set out to do. Maybe you weren&rsquo;t writing this screenplay as an exercise in formalist storytelling. Maybe you were writing it for the moms. Maybe you were trying to tell <em>their</em> story: the secret story of birth, which, in the movies, is so often played for laughs, reduced to a few minutes of sexualized huffing and puffing and cursing, followed by a tearful cuddle with an eerily beatific, gleaming-clean, six month-old stunt-baby.</p>
<p>But I saw this in a theater full of moms, and there was never that big moment of shared recognition, that cathartic uniting of the audience behind an unspoken truth suddenly, shockingly, candidly exposed. In a film that should have been full of such moments, there are none. Even <em>The Avengers</em> was able to unite the assembled geeks and nerds and fanboys in spontaneous cheers at the sight of the Helicarrier, Avengers Tower, Thanos: all that secret folklore made wonderfully public. Surely childbirth has a more beautiful, vital mythology than the Marvel Universe? &nbsp;</p>
<p>My issue, Heather, is that you took a book that became iconic for its gruesome, pragmatic, uncompromising honesty and turned it into a movie that has nothing remotely honest to say.</p>
<p>Like I said earlier, as a mother of two you were no doubt qualified to write this screenplay. But, as a mother of two, how do you feel about promoting these bland platitudes about pregnancy?</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jared Young</p>
