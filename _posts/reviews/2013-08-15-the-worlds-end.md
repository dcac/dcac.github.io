Five middle-aged men walk into a pub--

No, that isn't a start of a lame joke. It's the start of the wildest Friday night the town of Newton Haven has ever seen.  And also the beginning of the third installment in Edgar Wright's Cornetto trilogy.

So, five middle-aged men walk into a pub, on a mission to complete a pub crawl they started twenty years earlier. Having drifted apart over the years, they find themselves in their forties with a whack of unresolved issues, and are trying to recapture a bit of the optimism and promise of their youth.

Here's the thing about adults, Luke. There comes a point where they spend a lot of time looking back. They remember how dynamic and fearless they were in their younger days, and lament the loss of that fearlessness that comes with the onset of adult life, responsibilities, achy joints, the filling out, the slowing down, etc. It can all get a bit maudlin, so it's nice to have a distraction. Like wondering if or how they will live through the night.

 As the five roll up and start cutting a path of destruction down the Golden Mile, their antics might get repetitive to the point where one starts to question why a town needs twelve pubs when five would have been sufficient to get the point across. Luckily, though, our five heroes aren't the only ones who have changed. They notice the townsfolk are acting very weird. _Creepy_ weird. And there's beer involved. Things get real messy, real fast.

While I am madly impressed that you and your fellow young actors did your own stunt work, I was most taken by the film's refusal to indulge in too much mid-life crisis navel gazing. The actors have their moments of lamentation, but it's in the subsequent scenes of mad aggression in which they really shine. There's a clear catharsis when a lethargic, soft-middled dad pile-drives someone into the ground. A palpable moment of self-actualization when they rip the head off someone else. Bathed in gooey blue blood (by the way, _gross_) and a gooey sense of camaraderie, these aging friends are able to face the end of everything with a special kind of dignity.

As the townspeople of New Haven, you and your fellow background players give the stars a run for their money. The skillfully choreographed and executed fight sequences had us all cheering in our seats. It all manifests itself as high octane, beer fuelled, laugh-a-minute action set to that early 90s mix tape I played constantly back in middle school.
