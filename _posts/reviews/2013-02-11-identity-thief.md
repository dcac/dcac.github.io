<p>I&rsquo;m sorry to bother you this afternoon, Mr. Bateman, but our records indicate that you may have recently been the victim of identity fraud. Shocking, yes, I know. But before I can go any further, I need to ask you a few personal questions to verify that you&rsquo;re the Jason Bateman we&rsquo;re looking for.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your earliest recurring roles were on which television shows? That&rsquo;s right, <em>Silver Spoons</em> and <em>Little House on the Prairie</em>. And the 80s sitcom that cemented your B-level fame? <em>The Hogan Family</em>, correct. After that, having toiled for a while in TV-movie obscurity, which short-lived role transmogrified your career? Of course, yes, <em>Arrested Development </em>(though we also would have accepted Pepper Brooks in <em>Dodgeball</em>).</p>
<p>Okay, thank you very much, Mr. Bateman. We can proceed.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Let&rsquo;s run down the details of this incident so that we can clear this up.&nbsp; Since building up professional equity as a member of one of the most dysfunctional television families of all time, your work history is rife with discrepancies.&nbsp;</p>
<p>An actor claiming to be you has appeared in a series of big-budget middlebrow comedies: <em>Couples Retreat, Hit &amp; Run</em>, <em>The Change-Up</em>, <em>The Switch</em> (this last pair, apparently, are two completely different movies). Typically, he is the anally-retentive male half of an upper-middle-class suburban couple, occasionally as an officer of the law, but always as the parochial straight-man: conservative, anxious, always reacting with a sort of detached consternation to the buffoonery that surrounds him.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Identity Thief</em> is the latest film in which this phony has leveraged your good name for personal gain. The buffoonery is provided by Melissa McCarthy, who falls and flails and curses and throat-punches as a colorful South Florida con-artist who steals the identity of a (you guessed it!) straight-laced suburban family-man.</p>
<p>Mrs. McCarthy seems, in this role, to be her true authentic self (although there is a case pending due to her Will Ferrell-like similitude). But the Bateman-imposter coasts from opening to closing credits relying on the feints and parries you perfected on television but have never had the chance to fully explore in film. There&rsquo;s a certain grace to playing the straight-man that you captured perfectly as Michael Bluth, and a gravitas to your inherent (and acerbic) seriousness that works wonders in the few dramatic roles you&rsquo;ve been given. But we can spot a fake (it&rsquo;s our job), and this con artist can&rsquo;t hold a candle to you. Identity Thief ends up being another middling bit of February filler that isn&rsquo;t amusing enough to resonate longer than the thirty seconds it takes to leave the theater.&nbsp; &nbsp;</p>
<p>This is also the second time your doppelganger has worked with director Seth Gordon (we&rsquo;ll be contacting him, too: the atrophic disparity between <em>King of Kong</em>, his directorial debut, and his subsequent two films, have raised some suspicions about the security of his professional records, too). We hope to prevent such collusion from happening again.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Thank you for your time. We will immediately put a hold on all casting decisions bearing your name and begin taking measure to see that some of this lost equity is paid back to you in a timely fashion. Please log in to your Screen Actor&rsquo;s Guild account and change your passwords. We&rsquo;re glad to have cleared this up.</p>
<p>Thank you very much, Mr. Bateman. Have a terrific afternoon.</p>
<p>Jared Young</p>
