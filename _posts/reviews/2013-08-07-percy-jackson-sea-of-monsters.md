<p><em style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Claude Par&eacute;,</strong> Production Designer,</em></p>
<p>It&rsquo;s not easy creating a magical world where modernity and Greek myth co-exist (not to mention live-action and computer animation), but you did a great job on <em>Percy Jackson: Sea of Monsters</em>.&nbsp; It didn&rsquo;t hurt that you helmed a solid crew that included <em>Rhythm &amp; Hues Studios</em> animators who recently earned <em>Life of Pi</em> a Best Visual Effects Oscar. Your experience working on blockbusters like <em>Rise of the Planet of the Apes</em> and <em>Night at the Museum</em> certainly helped as well. But what surprised me most was that, despite the film&rsquo;s being a relentless 3D visual extravaganza, your work didn&rsquo;t detract from characters and plot. Contemporary teenage movies often rely on bombastic visual effects for entertainment with the end result soulless. How <em>Sea of Monsters </em>evaded that trap is intriguing.</p>
<p>You seem to know when to kick back and let others do their thing. In this sequel to <em>The Lightning Thief &ndash; </em>the first adaptation of author Rick Riordan&rsquo;s YA series <em>Percy Jackson &amp; the Olympians &ndash;</em> you left room for director Thor Frudenthal to focus on young demigod Percy&rsquo;s coming of age. This made the movie more powerful than its predecessor, in which meaning was lost. In <em>Sea of Monsters</em>, Percy embarks on a journey to find the Golden Fleece that could save Camp Half-Blood, a demigod training centre, from destruction by Hermes&rsquo; rebellious son Luke. Along the way, Percy and his band of young heroes test their powers and limitations; they face their demons and mature. Recurring are the travails of parent-child relations: Percy feels abandoned by his father the Sea God Poseidon, and Luke&rsquo;s fury towards elusive Hermes pushes him to commit evil acts. Parents and young viewers will both relate to this topic.</p>
<p>The film&rsquo;s footing in Greek myth provided a golden opportunity for you and your crew to show off your talents. Magical Hippocampus, half-horse and half-fish, was impressive with dazzling pink and green scales that recalled a Monet water lily painting. The Oracle of Delphi was an original robot with incandescent eyes whose narration of the legend of Kronos &ndash; the King of the Titans who ate his own children &ndash; was told in a spellbinding stained-glass animated sequence. It was an ingenious way to tell a brutal story without getting too graphic. These clever circumventions of gratuitous violence are present throughout the film, making it totally kid-friendly.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But the film had some glitches. The Gray Sisters&rsquo; taxi stunts, for instance, were overwrought and interrupted the movie&rsquo;s flow. Polyphemus, played by 6-foot-10 Acadian boxer Robert Maillet, was disappointing.&nbsp; Supposed to be one of the film&rsquo;s deadliest monsters, in the end his role was negligible. This was unfortunate since Maillet&rsquo;s imposing stature and charisma made him perfect for the part. With these inconsistencies, the <em>Percy Jackson</em> film series has yet to show it can live up to mega-hits like <em>Pirates of the Caribbean </em>or <em>Harry Potter</em>.</p>
<p>Claude, you were nonetheless able to create a world that was both fantastic and believable. You supported Frudenthal&rsquo;s emphasis on the very relevant and relatable growing pains of teenage gods, which made <em>Sea of Monsters</em> more substantial than <em>The Lightning Thief</em>. The series is on the comeback trail; families should enjoy this latest edition.</p>
<p>Surprisingly Entertained,</p>
<p>Katherine</p>
