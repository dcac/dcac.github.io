You are [responsible for](https://variety.com/exec/sanford-panitch/) the ‘Marvel universe’ within Sony Pictures Entertainment. So I take it you’re the best person to answer my question: _Venom 2: Let There Be Carnage_ is just an excuse for a post-credit scene, right?

_Venom 2_ has been a hit for Sony since its release. It has officially [crossed the $400M mark ](https://deadline.com/2021/11/venom-let-there-be-carnage-crosses-400-million-global-box-office-1234867905/#:~:text=Sony's%20Venom%3A%20Let%20There,%24404.1M%20cume%20through%20Tuesday.)which is great, especially by pandemic standards. And although the movie is fun (to a degree), I can’t help but feel the entire production serves as a lead-in for a juicy post-credit scene that changes the game for cinematic universes.

It started with the early social media reactions for _Venom 2_ back in September. All the [fervor around the film](https://www.gamesradar.com/venom-2-reactions-let-there-be-carnage/) wasn’t about the film itself, but rather, the post-credits scene. Then, came the [no spoilers campaign](https://screenrant.com/venom-2-spoilers-poster-tom-hardy/)—something that has become synonymous with the superhero blockbuster surprise tease. Not spoiling a movie should be common practice for any release but after watching _Venom 2,_ there isn’t anything worth spoiling aside from the post-credit scene.

And then came the day of my screening. I grabbed my reserved tickets only for the attendant to say, “stick around until the end.”

C’mon, Panitch. You and I both know the Sony rep doesn’t care if I stick around until the end unless she was specifically told to say that as part of the marketing push from top brass.

Therein lies the problem with _Let There Be Carnage_. It’s not the post-credit scene itself (which is very exciting). No, it’s the film’s dependency on said scene to make up for its shortcomings.

_Venom 2: Let There Be Carnage_ is a chaotic misadventure that moves fast and breaks things. Its breezy 90-minute runtime—although a welcome relief from unnecessarily long blockbusters, rushes through all its important bits in favour of the good stuff. And I’m not talking about the ooey-gooey finale full of CG tentacle hentai porn. I’m talking about the post-credit scene. 

Everything _Venom 2_ does, it does to get to the end. The movie flies through Eddie Brock and Venom’s odd couple relationship. I think the pivotal separation between the two lasts 20-25 minutes tops? 

There isn’t much that establishes Cletus Kasady as a psychopathic serial killer. He mostly sits behind a cell and talks in riddles like he’s in a Fincher movie. The worst thing he does on-screen is kill a man for his vacation shirt—oh, the humanity!

There’s a lack of build-up to establish Cletus Kasady and Shriek’s (Naomie Harris) romantic relationship. Everything is summed up in a brief animated montage. Come to think of it, Oscar-nominated Naomie Harris barely has any speaking lines. 

Even the big climactic battle at the end—the thing that embodies the superhero third act—lasts only a couple of minutes followed by an _immediate_ jump cut to a sunset by the beach.

All this says to me is that _Venom 2_ was never a standalone priority for Sony. I doubt anyone who has seen _Venom 2_ will disagree when I say, if the events of this film never happened, minus the post-credit scene, it would not impact Sony's plans for their Spider-Man Universe.
