excerpt: "There&rsquo;s something to be said for having physical, tactile elements in front of the camera. Knowing that what&rsquo;s being filmed isn&rsquo;t just a bunch of ones and zeros, but a solid substance &ndash; that I, like you, could hold in my hand &ndash; often makes the action and characters feel just as tangible. It&rsquo;s a shame that poor 3D effects and a 2D script had to undermine your efforts."

<p>There&rsquo;s something to be said for having physical, tactile elements in front of the camera. Knowing that what&rsquo;s being filmed isn&rsquo;t just a bunch of ones and zeros, but a solid substance &ndash; that I, like you, could hold in my hand &ndash; often makes the action and characters feel just as tangible. It&rsquo;s a shame that poor 3D effects and a 2D script had to undermine your efforts.</p>
<p>What happened?</p>
<p>The titular band of misfits you created certainly fit the physical bill for a family comedy: The Pirate Captain as bushy-bearded leader, The Pirate with Gout as tubby sidekick, The Surprisingly Curvaceous Pirate as tomboy-in-disguise, The Albino Pirate as&hellip;well, maybe a way to save on your paint budget (his condition was strangely never mentioned). Sure they looked good, but it&rsquo;s what&rsquo;s on the inside that counts&mdash;even with clay puppets.</p>
<p>For an adventure that positions Charles Darwin as the morally ambiguous ally and Queen Victoria as the villain, there&rsquo;s a surprising lack of punch to the comedy. The Pirate Captain&rsquo;s vain attempt to win the Pirate of the Year award is a worthy story engine, but the lengthy set-up of his poorly-voiced adversaries never pays off like it should. Like the pirates themselves who are constantly disappointed by their lackluster looting, I also expected bigger rewards from the studio that gave us <em>Wallace and Grommit</em>.&nbsp; Instead, I left with a modest bounty that is bound to drown in a sea of better animated films.</p>
