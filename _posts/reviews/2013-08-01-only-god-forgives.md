excerpt: "You'll notice I'm not attaching one of your own photos to this letter. There wasn't much point. As good as your work is, Shi, it never tops the meticulously composed framing of _Only God Forgives_. There's a Stanley Kubrick-level of discipline to every single shot of this film, which feels pretty apt, coming from _Eyes Wide Shut_ cinematographer Larry Smith. I mean the guy's first film gig was chief electrician on _Barry Lyndon_ - clearly he knows a thing or two about lighting. Then some fresh face like you comes a long and basically gets to enjoy the ride. The lighting is perfect, the mood is crystal clear, and all you're asked to do is pull the trigger. You probably felt like a character in a Nicolas Winding Refn film, not one of his employees."

Yes, the Danish director of _Drive_ and _Valhalla Rising_ has certainly created a brand for himself and his characters. In fact, along with _Only God Forgives_, these three films could be described as his silent avenger trilogy. Only this time, there are two quiet forces exacting vengeance on one another - Julian (Ryan Gosling), a drug dealing Muay Thai boxer on a reluctant mission to avenge his slain bother, and Chang (Vithaya Pansringarm), a sword-wielding police officer out to _Kill Bill_â€¦ or Julian, or whoever wronged him. As long as he makes a bloody disgusting point while doing it. In that sense, Pansringarm feels more like Winding Refn's muse than Gosling. Regardless, both actors are essentially blunt instruments painted in bold, broad colours - just like the film as a whole. 

The authorial continuity from _Drive_ is unmistakable, but in _Only God Forgives_, it's hard not to pick apart the director's external influences. Winding Refn might have dedicated the film to avant-garde artist and cinematic shit-disturber Alejandro Jodorosky, but that feels more based on him being an emotional role model. I'm talking more about aesthetics. There's the aforementioned Kubrickian symmetry and stillness to the framing, but also moments reminiscent of David Lynch's hypnotic elliptical editing, Ingmar Bergman-esque dream sequences and David Cronenberg's disturbing approach to sexualizing violence. Filmmakers are rarely mentioned in such respected company, but there's a caveat. This film might be filled with striking and beautiful images, but it's often feels soulless. It has the strange ability to walk the walk of an art film, but not talk the talk. The message is simply about how cool something can look.

I know, you're not complaining. As a still photographer, why would you?

But as an audience member, I craved a little more to chew on. Cutting out excessive dialogue is a virtue more films should follow, but there's a lack of characterization, social commentary or even subtext here to fill in the gaps. It's essentially moving pictures strung together using the outline of a Greek tragedy via Bangkok. Don't get me wrong - I rather enjoyed watching the whole thing, but mostly on the level of moving pictures. You understand.
