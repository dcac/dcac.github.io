Hey James, I just wanted to let you know how happy I am that the tinnitus you suffered mixing _Clash of the Titans_ was not permanent. I knew your recovery from that cacophonous mess was complete listening to the quiet, almost reflective soundscape of _The Secret World of Arrietty_. And what a pleasure it is to watch an animated film that is not overstuffed with wise-cracking animals and fart noises, but has the confidence to rely on character, story, and tone to enrapture an audience.

Yours in silence,

Casey
