_“It shouldn’t have been approved internally let alone gone all the way to make it into the film. That shocked me a bit. We were all looking at each other when the film started like ’WTF is this?!’”_

This is you, a DC effects artist, on the record (but withholding your name) during a Reddit AMA.  You’re speaking about the now-infamous post production repair work done in the opening scene of _Justice League_. Granted, you weren’t talking about your own contributions to removing Henry Cavill’s post-film moustache in other re-shot parts of the movie, but this quote still seems to perfectly summarize a lot about _Justice League_.

It’s not that _Justice League_ is a terrible film, per se — it actually works much better than many of its forebears, especially the Zack Snyder-directed[ _Man of Steel_](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2013/6/14/man-of-steel.html) and [_Batman v. Superman: Dawn of Justice_](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2016/3/29/batman-v-superman-dawn-of-justice.html) (although comes nowhere close to the thrills of [_Wonder Woman_](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2017/6/16/wonder-woman.html)). No, like the clumsy depilation of Cavill’s Clark Kent, _Justice League_ feels reactionary and rushed, not fully thought through.

It’s an exhausting affair: Fitting Batman, Superman, Wonder Woman, The Flash, Aquaman, and Cyborg would be hard enough without also worrying about side stories for Lois Lane and Martha Kent. Heck, I got tired just typing all those names out.

When you factor in a runtime of less than two hours, everything—and everyone—ends up being reduced to storytelling signifiers more than actual moments and characters. I mean, this is a movie co-written by Joss Whedon, co-starring Joe Morton as a scientist working on advance cybertronics that can’t even find a few seconds for a sly Miles Dyson reference. Yes, it’s a crying shame.

Factoring all this into account, it’s no wonder that the main plot of _Justice League_, which concerns a series of Skyrim-level scenes of a CGI character named Steppenwolf* trying to conquer Earth (natch) is near indecipherable.

_*Seriously, as a special effects guy, can you provide any insider details on what kind of Faustian bargain Warner/DC made that’s resulted in the godawful, impenetrably dark CGI that plagues every one of these films?_

I’m not just talking about the lack of groundwork laid in previous instalments for all the characters introduced in _Justice League_, however. True, Disney/Marvel did a lot more heavy lifting to get mainstream audiences ready for the first [Avengers](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2012/5/11/the-avengers.html) film. (Before 2008 did the average action fan know or care who or what an Iron Man is?)  Even if _Justice Leagues_ three new characters didn’t have to rely on a hackneyed introduction in _Batman v. Superman_, in which they are introduced by that classic of cinematic conventions, email, _Justice League_ would still feel like a patchwork quilt sewn together by multiple contributors.

The reason for that is most likely that _Justice League_ was itself patched together by two main contributors: Snyder and Whedon, both of whom directed scenes. While I’m loathe to factor in extra-textual sources when reading a film, in this case the film itself makes this clear. Whedon and Snyder are such different stylists — one relies on more basic, TV-style camera setups; one interested in visual style to the detriment of any kind of coherent storytelling (I’ll let you guess who is who) — that seeing them in the same film creates an inescapable stylistic dissonance.

The true miracle of _Justice League_ is that it does manage to create a few compelling moments for its ill-defined, underdeveloped cast. Through the late contributions of Whedon, brought in to add some much-needed levity and character,  _Justice League_ escapes becoming the complete dirge that is _Batman v. Superman_.

Still, I can’t help but return to your opening quote. _Justice League_, like the shortcuts taken in the work forced on your and your fellow artists, shows the scars of being rushed to hit a release date more than make a good film. And no amount of digital trickery can erase that.
