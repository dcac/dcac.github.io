<p><em style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Trevor Morris</strong>, Composer,</em></p>
<p>In junior high, while my peers were awakened by the atonal notes of the early-90s alt-rock movement and the emigration of hip-hop from the inner city to the suburbs, I spent my time at the local record store flipping through the soundtracks bin. James Horner and James Newton Howard were my Pearl Jam and Nirvana. Hans Zimmer&rsquo;s gang of synth-inspired virtuosos were my Wu-Tang Clan. I made mix-tapes that cleverly segued between the militaristic pan flutes from the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lUgH-lBeX_M">opening scene of <em>Clear and Present Danger</em></a> to the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lnywcTqsg18">theme from <em>Con Air</em></a> to Basil Poledouris&rsquo;s weirdly brilliant score for the <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=g20YT2jzDb0">decidedly unbrilliant Under Siege 2: Dark Territory</a>. Clearly, Trevor, you&rsquo;re likewise an aficionado of action movie musicology.</p>
<p>You must be, because the score you composed for <em>Olympus Has Fallen</em> relies so heavily on the tropes and devices of these old standards &ndash; from the somber horns over the opening credits to the choral hymn that plays over the final frames &ndash; that the experience is akin to time-travel.</p>
<p>But when I say <em>rely</em>, perhaps I mean <em>pay tribute to</em>. And what I call <em>tropes</em> are perhaps <em>themes</em>. The difference in these taxonomical details is the difference between a brilliant throwback parody of pre-millennium action flicks and a misanthropic wannabe-blockbuster drowning in its own manufactured gravitas.</p>
<p>So, let me ask you: just which one of these movies is <em>Olympus Has Fallen</em>?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m guessing the first. Because there&rsquo;s no way director Antoine Fuqua didn&rsquo;t know what he was doing. This is satire on the level of <em>Dr. Strangelove</em>. This is parody executed with a verve worthy of the Zucker Brothers. All without a single note of irony that might give away the joke. Let&rsquo;s set aside the eerily familiar structure of the plot (this movie is a companion piece to <em>Die Hard</em> in the same way that Dark Side of the Moon is a companion piece to <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>: built over its skeleton). Gerard Butler is certainly in on it, stalking around all John Wayne-like and growling in a breathless Batman-voice. Morgan Freeman, too, seems to be doing an impression of Morgan Freeman playing Morgan Freeman. And your music, Trevor, makes sure that this self-consciousness is never too subtle. Aaron Eckhardt, the President held-hostage, trapped by terrorists in the White House basement, can&rsquo;t walk down a hallway or open a door or even blink without the horn section swelling to crescendo.</p>
<p>How ingenious for Fuqua to construct a sequence as outrageously inhumane as the first act attack perpetrated against the people of Washington, DC (they&rsquo;re gunned down by invading North Koreans in a circling jumbo jet that is inexplicably able to cruise into the capitol&rsquo;s airspace), all the while keeping the action safely on the side of implausibility so that everything potentially offensive about it is merely funny. What&rsquo;s brilliant about it is that people will watch this movie and <em>totally think you guys were trying to make a real movie!</em></p>
<p>But here is the best compliment I can pay you, Trevor: if I had seen this flick at the age of fourteen, I&rsquo;d right now be scanning the CD racks looking for your name.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Jared Young&nbsp;</p>
