You're already getting the gears from the online Nerderati about how much your new film _Lockout_ - as of the mailing of this letter, still unreleased - owes to John Carpenter's sci-fi cult classic _Escape From New York._ And they're not wrong: the super-max prison (yours is on a space station), the first-family hostage (you've swapped the salt-and-pepper President for his comely daughter, played here by Maggie Grace), the squinty, thuggish, quick-witted super-soldier (you traded young Kurt Russell for not-so-young Guy Pearce), and an escape-pod-load of other Easter-eggs I surely missed.

But there's a lot more going on here than a slavish ripping-off of everyone's favourite post-apocalyptic action-comedy, isn't there?

First of all, let's not call it a rip-off, because that implies an act of theft. Shakespeare borrowed liberally from Plutarch's _Parallel Lives_ to conjure rich historical details in plays like _Antony & Cleopatra_, and, as in his work, which enriched and contextualized existing tropes, all the appropriation here is above board. In fact, it seems to be the whole point. So let's call _Lockout_ what it is: a tribute.

But it's not just _Escape_ that you're borrowing from; and it's not just a genre, or style, or era. It's…well, _everything_.

There are direct allusion to _Aliens_ and _Die Hard_, minor tics and twitches adopted from _The Road Warrior_ and _Minority Report_, a denouement that unfolds like a parody of _The Usual Suspects_, and even a weirdly misplaced impression of Dustin Hoffman in _Rain Main_. On paper, at least, you created the ultimate mash-up flick.

_Lockout_, then, should be a cinema geek's nirvana. But the whole is slightly less than the sum of its parts. It doesn't - it _can't_, really - live up to the high standard set by all those other films. That's the danger of riffing, in the Shakespearian manner, off past masterpieces: sometimes, in the remixing, what made them great is lost.

Anyways, what I wanted to tell you, Luc, is that I appreciated the effort.

PS. I think you and I both know that the real reason to sit through these 90 minutes is for Guy Pearce. His Snake McClane (or John Plissken--tomato, to_mah_-to) is able to make more of your often blocky dialogue than poor Maggie Grace, who spends half the flick looking like Tetsuo from _Akira_. He's a worthy heir to Russell, and his performance is the closest _Lockout_ ever gets to playing on the same field as its source material.
