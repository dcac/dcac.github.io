Like a lovelorn schoolboy with a pet falcon on his shoulder and vintage Coronet midget camera around his neck, the influence of Wes Anderson is present in every frame of _Safety Not Guaranteed_. It's subtle, but it's there: the center-framed shots, the self-conscious eclecticism, the tippy-toed dance on the precipice of absurdity--these are the seeds from which director Colin Treverrow has grown his first feature film. And what defines a Wes Anderson film more powerfully than its music? 

So, in seeking to establish a unique sonic mood, Treverrow came to you. This is what he gave you to work with: a flick based on the feeble premise that a local magazine would send a reporter and two interns (immediately the limits of disbelief's tensile strength are tested) to investigate a mysterious classified ad seeking recruits for a time travel adventure (in the fashion that movie magazine writers investigate their stories: snooping around, stalking their subjects, secretly staking them out, ie. the way that no magazine writers have/will ever done/do).

One can debate the merits of Aubrey Plaza as a leading lady (personally, her doe-eyed monotone wore thin pretty fast, but I nonetheless understand her deadpan, zero-sum allure). One can debate, too, whether Mark Duplass's mumblecore sincerity contributes or detracts from the aforementioned Andersonian absurdity dance. But the naked fact is this: it's your endless selection of hyper-earnest post-grunge alt-rock, played over the opening and end credits, through every scene transition, during every quiet beat in which silence might have allowed for a moment of consideration, that really wrecked the movie's mood for me.

Anderson's self-consciousness has purpose; it's almost metatextual. But the way Treverrow punctuates each moment of sentiment with one of your sentimental indie tunes proves _Safety_ to be nothing more than a cheap knock-off, a Coronet midget camera manufactured to cash in on a hipsterist craze for the quirky and different.
