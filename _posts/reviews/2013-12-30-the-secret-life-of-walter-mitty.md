<p><em><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Horny Chileans</strong>, Actors,</span></em></p>
<p>Though your true names are <span>Jos&eacute; Alcantara</span>, Rodrigo <span>Sepulveda</span>, Seba Al&oacute;n, Miguel Baez-Olavarria, <span>Daniel Marinado Orellana</span>, Antonio Molina, Martin Lagos, and Andres Quezada, I refer to you by your stage name in <em>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty,</em> a comedy that accordingly explores the fine line between the fictional and real. The movie also celebrates underdogs, mind you, so who better address this letter to than you? Your short-lived performance embodied the humor with which the film tackles difficult issues, and marked a turning point in the movie&rsquo;s plot.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</em>, directed by and starring Ben Stiller as Walter Mitty, is based on a 1930s American short story about an insecure man who escapes the mundane through daydreaming. The novella was first made into a film in the 1940s, and now Hollywood has provided this 21<sup>st</sup> century adaptation in which Mitty is a forlorn middle-aged space cadet who works for Life magazine in New York.</p>
<p>Mitty&rsquo;s boss (Adam Scott) bullies him; he pines after a co-worker (Kristen Wiig) he dare not ask out.&nbsp; Moreover, &lsquo;Life&rsquo; is undergoing a series of tough changes: the magazine is going strictly online, publishing its last issue, and downsizing its staff.&nbsp; When things seem like they couldn&rsquo;t get worse, Mitty loses the negative for the last issue&rsquo;s cover photo.</p>
<p>Desperate to save his job, and longing to break free from a colorless life, Mitty resolves to find the cover picture&rsquo;s photographer (Sean Penn) to retrieve the lost negative.&nbsp; The photographer&rsquo;s a daredevil who&rsquo;s always on the go, so Mitty must travel the world to find him.</p>
<p>Enter horny Chilean sailors.&nbsp; You dock in a remote port in Iceland at the same time as Mitty, who&rsquo;s searching for his photographer.&nbsp; But you&rsquo;re searching for the nearest strip-joint.&nbsp; In the port, a lone bicycle offers the only means of transportation.&nbsp; You charge for the bike, emboldened by your voracious sexual appetites, but Mitty grabs it first and rides off, emboldened by his desire to live a meaningful life.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Up until this point, Mitty was a fainthearted character. But racing horny Chilean sailors, and winning, inadvertently reignites his desire to sink his teeth into life.&nbsp; Your scene embodies the humorous way <em>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty </em>depicts how a depressed individual comes into his own, but it also highlights the important role that underdogs play in shaping outcomes in life. Indeed, that&rsquo;s one of the movie&rsquo;s messages: everybody counts; everybody has a part to play in the larger scheme of things&hellip; whether you&rsquo;re a horny Chilean sailor who&rsquo;s just come back from sea or a middle-aged geek who&rsquo;s looking for adventure.</p>
<p>In its subplot, the movie addresses hard topics like coping with a loved one&rsquo;s death, or with debilitating insecurity; but it does so in a light-hearted inspirational way. &nbsp;By way of example, as I exited the movie theatre, a man and woman from the crowd in front of me were playfully spanking each other, which spoke volumes about the film&rsquo;s uplifting effect. I can&rsquo;t imagine playful spanks after <em>Dancer in the Dark</em> or <em>Schindler&rsquo;s List</em>.</p>
<p><em>The Secret Life of Walter Mitty</em> is a finely executed Hollywood comedy with your typical blend of action, romance, and a moralistic happy ending. There&rsquo;s nothing particularly brilliant about it; but it&rsquo;s not too shabby either.&nbsp; With strong performances, nice scenery, and a solid soundtrack with songs by the likes of David Bowie and Arcade Fire, the movie holds its own.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s just one major discrepancy: the movie urges viewers to live life to the fullest, yet to see the film you have to sit inactively for hours on end in a dark cinema, living vicariously through improbable fictional characters. &nbsp;While Walter Mitty transforms into a man of action on screen, viewers are transform into Mitty&rsquo;s former self, dreaming life away&hellip;</p>
<p>Perplexed,</p>
