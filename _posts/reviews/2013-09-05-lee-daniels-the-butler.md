<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><em><strong>Dear Harvey Weinstein</strong>, Executive Producer,</em></span></p>
<p>You have something of a reputation for your Oscar campaigns. Whether it&rsquo;s by persistence, determination, or simply spending the most money, you get the job done, transforming movie ducklings into swans ready to step up to the podium and thank god, their agents, and you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>You must have thought you&rsquo;d have an easy win with <em>Lee Daniels&rsquo; The Butler</em>.&nbsp; It has Oscar-bait written all over it: a previously nominated director in Daniels and a worthy subject in the American civil rights movement. The movie&rsquo;s real-life inspiration &ndash; an African-American butler who served eight presidents &ndash; had an insider&rsquo;s view on some of 20<sup>th</sup> Century America&rsquo;s most important historical events, and Daniels is able to revel in them. The film has a star-laden cast led by America&rsquo;s most powerful woman, Oprah Winfrey, and it offers the Academy an embarrassment of riches with which it might reverse its disgraceful lack of minority nominations.&nbsp; You should be able to coast through until the Oscar ceremony, right?</p>
<p>Except this may be an uphill battle. There&rsquo;s the story, for one thing: your fictional Cecil Gaines has little in common with the real-life Eugene Allen, beyond that they were both White House butlers and both went to a Reagan-era state dinner. &nbsp;Daniels and screenwriter Danny Strong have decided that Cecil Gaines, ably played by Forest Whitaker, needs a tragic childhood to haunt him and an activist son (David Oyelowo) to clash with. Early on, Gaines learns that he must wear two faces: one for his white employers and another for his family and friends.&nbsp; This duality is a powerful idea to explore, but it&rsquo;s not something so much explored as explained to us, repeatedly, in voiceover.</p>
<p>That voiceover, Harvey!&nbsp; Whitaker has every reason to expect a nomination for his work here, except that his own narration undercuts his performance at every turn, telegraphing his epiphanies and evolution. The other actors fare better.&nbsp; Winfrey tears into her role, not quite dimming her charisma, but never allowing her Oprah-ness to overwhelm. She does her best work in close-ups or acting against Terence Howard as her smarmy neighbour, though struggles mightily to wrestle with a script that has her use the occasion of JFK&rsquo;s assassination to complain about her husband needing to spend more time at home.</p>
<p>The movie really comes alive in the smaller moments &ndash; at house parties, or Gaines joking in the kitchen with the other staff &ndash; and I would have loved more of that insider&rsquo;s view, in the vein of West Wing or Downton Abbey. But there&rsquo;s always a new presidential impersonation to wonder at. There&rsquo;s the rebellious son, Louis, turning up to bring to the forefront whatever is going on politically at the moment.</p>
<p>There is one wonderful sequence, of Louis and his fellow activists taking part in a lunch counter sit-in, and the abuse they suffer is intercut with a formal White House dinner; it&rsquo;s further intercut with scenes of the activists preparing&mdash;role-playing, wondering what will happen to them.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s marvelous both for its energy and the way it conveys just how much work went into the civil rights movement. We feel, both viscerally and intellectually, how hard-won those changes were, and how wide a gulf existed between Cecil Gaines&rsquo; two worlds.&nbsp; That&rsquo;s your Oscar moment right there, Harvey.</p>
<p>(Just make sure you remove the scene in which Louis slams Sidney Poitier from the screener&mdash;that&rsquo;s not something the Academy will forgive.)</p>
<p>See you at awards season,</p>
<p>Erin</p>
