<p>You must tell me your secret. Echinacea? Gene supplements? Cryogenic freezing? It&rsquo;s not that I find it amazing that you&rsquo;ve lived to the ripe old age 103; no, Chinese peasants and Indian yogis do it all the time. What I find amazing is that you&rsquo;ve maintained your artistic faculties to this late stage, and &ndash; perhaps <em>more</em> amazingly &ndash; are using them to pose questions about the very act of filmmaking that, after more than eight decades behind the camera, you&rsquo;re still engaged in.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s a distinct timelessness to your 2010 film <em>The Strange Case of Angelica</em>. And I suspect it&rsquo;s more than just the usual encroachment of Europe&rsquo;s hefty cultural history. It&rsquo;s impossible to tell, in the opening few scenes, what year the film takes places in. Only later, as we follow a sleek modern sedan cruising through the streets of a contemporary Portuguese city, is it clear we are rooted in the present.</p>
<p>But only sort of. Right, Manny?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Anachronisms reign throughout; Isaac &ndash; a Jewish photographer who is summoned to the estate of a wealthy family to take a portrait of their recently deceased daughter &ndash; uses a 60s-era Leica, and his studio is decidedly analog: a lot of plastic bins filled with chemicals, developing proofs clothes-pinned to hanging wires. Ancient funerary customs are observed, yet references are made to the current European economic crisis and the study of antimatter. &nbsp;</p>
<p>And still, this film feels a half-century old. At least.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Why? The camera is heavy, rooted to the ground. With very few exceptions, it never tilts; never pans; never tracks. You&rsquo;ve cut this story together from a series of carefully composed static shots. This aesthetic is reflected tonally. Your dialogue is straightforward; your plotting is linear. Some elements suffer this approach (Isaac&rsquo;s relationship with his wisecracking lady landlord feels like something from a bad sitcom). Others, however, are buoyed by it. In the middle act, you conjure a strange dream sequence that might seem absurd except for how perfectly it represents the ideas at the heart of your film: the tension between new and old.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Funny how one might watch this and, not knowing the filmmaker is a centenarian, accuse the auteur of not knowing enough about film theory. But it&#8217;s the opposite of that, isn&#8217;t it? It&#8217;s not a lack that we see onscreen; rather a stripping-down to the essentials. In fact, one of Isaac&rsquo;s fellow lodgers uses an apt filmic metaphor in that discussion about the duality of matter and antimatter: &ldquo;No big special effects, like on a Hollywood movie.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I guess, then, your advice about defying the laws of aging is right there in the film: the old is the fundament upon which everything new is built.&nbsp;</p>
<p>When Isaac gazes out of his window, one afternoon, and spies a group of laborers working in the vineyards on the other side of the river, his landlady asks him why he&rsquo;s so interested in watching them &ldquo;work the old-fashioned way.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Isaac tells her: &ldquo;Old-fashioned work interests me.&rdquo;&nbsp;</p>
<p>She counterpoints: &ldquo;They&#8217;re the only ones who do it the old way. Now we use machines.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Yes, everyone else is obsessed with the machinery, but you, Manoel&mdash; you&rsquo;re doing it the old way. Bravo!</p>
<p>Com carinho,</p>
