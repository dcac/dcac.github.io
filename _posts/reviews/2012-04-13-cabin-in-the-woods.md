<p>I understand the need for secrecy. I went in knowing only that I knew nothing, and that my knowing nothing was essential to the surprise. And despite the fact that I expected to be surprised, I was surprised.  So I&rsquo;ll keep this letter short, and describe my reaction in three words:</p>
<p>Holy. Fucking. Christ.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
