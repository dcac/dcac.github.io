<p>You blew it, Dave.</p><p>I know you were badly outgunned. I know the numbers were stacked against you. But you should have fought harder. When faced with a modern high-tech enemy, one hell-bent on rendering you obsolete, you need to stand your ground. It&rsquo;s the basic principle of every action movie&mdash;even the really bad ones (ahem). Instead, you let Hollywood supervillain Roland Emmerich win the day. His cheap, labour-saving, 90s-grade digital explosions undermine any sense of emotional stakes <em>White House Down </em>could have hoped to earn. When that first CGI flash erupted in the Capitol building, the only loss I mourned was your profession.</p><p>There&rsquo;s just no substitute for real fire. It&rsquo;s the reason <em>Backdraft </em>will still hold up 50 years from now*. Bad computer-generated flames lack any sense of danger and presence. They&rsquo;re an easy stock effect included in even the most basic consumer-level editing programs. Big budget movies usually manage to blend the practical effects with the computer wizardry, but this desire to integrate the real deal says something.</p><p>Hell, the fact an old-fashion fire-starter like you was even hired says <em>everything</em>.</p><p>Seeing a real pyrotechnic display really gets the blood going. It could be an actual hospital building, like in <em>The Dark Knight</em>. It could be a splintering miniature of the White House, like Emmerich previously blew up so effectively in <em>Independence Day </em>(which becomes a surprisingly unlaboured meta-reference in this, his new film). But a well-placed, well-executed blast accomplishes everything an action movie sets out to do. And trust me, this movie needed all the help it could get.</p><p>Where to start? The plodding pace that fails to generate an ounce of tension? The choppy slow-motion thrown in as an afterthought? The ham-fisted attempts at iconic moments, like the diplomatic president who, after being taunted for his &ldquo;&hellip;mightier than the sword&rdquo; philosophy, eventually stabs a villain with a ballpoint pen while shouting: &ldquo;I choose the pen!&rdquo; Yup, that actually happened&mdash;despite how hard the sound designers tried to bury it in the mix. But at least that moment was trying to do <em>something</em> new.</p><p>This is just another <em>Die Hard</em> cut-and-paste<em> </em>job. Even the title is lazy (another way that <a href="/letters/2013/3/22/olympus-has-fallen.html"><span style="color:windowtext;">Olympus Has Fallen proves itself a superior film</span></a>). From the self-narrating hero to hackers who cue up Beethoven music, <em>White House Down </em>is paying tribute in the worst way possible; by being derivative without being ironic. The tone is even insultingly mawkish, with spectators gathering outside the White House during a 9/11-level attack, cheering the military as if they&rsquo;re watching a rock concert. The film eventually devolves into a full-out comedy&mdash; well, at least <em>I</em> burst out laughing at the way the day was finally saved.</p><p>When everything feels fake, we&rsquo;re allowed to laugh. When things look great &ndash; like the wide shot of the crumbling Capitol building &ndash; we can&rsquo;t help but marvel. And that draws us in. There are a number of well-crafted moments in which the danger feels at least a little bit palpable, and in those scenes I can feel your work. But even Channing Tatum&rsquo;s undeniable charm isn&rsquo;t enough to bring the house down. Further down, I guess.</p><p>All fired-up,</p><p>Christopher</p><p>*I&rsquo;m amazed it took me this long to finally reference my favourite film growing up.</p></div>
