You blew it, Dave.

I know you were badly outgunned. I know the numbers were stacked against you. But you should have fought harder. When faced with a modern high-tech enemy, one hell-bent on rendering you obsolete, you need to stand your ground. It's the basic principle of every action movie--even the really bad ones (ahem). Instead, you let Hollywood supervillain Roland Emmerich win the day. His cheap, labour-saving, 90s-grade digital explosions undermine any sense of emotional stakes _White House Down_ could have hoped to earn. When that first CGI flash erupted in the Capitol building, the only loss I mourned was your profession. 

There's just no substitute for real fire. It's the reason _Backdraft_ will still hold up 50 years from now*. Bad computer-generated flames lack any sense of danger and presence. They're an easy stock effect included in even the most basic consumer-level editing programs. Big budget movies usually manage to blend the practical effects with the computer wizardry, but this desire to integrate the real deal says something .

Hell, the fact an old-fashion fire-starter like you was even hired says <em>everything</em>.

Seeing a real pyrotechnic display really gets the blood going. It could be an actual hospital building, like in _The Dark Knight_. It could be a splintering miniature of the White House, like Emmerich previously blew up so effectively in _Independence Day _(which becomes a surprisingly unlaboured meta-reference in this, his new film). But a well-placed, well-executed blast accomplishes everything an action movie sets out to do. And trust me, this movie needed all the help it could get .

Where to start? The plodding pace that fails to generate an ounce of tension? The choppy slow-motion thrown in as an afterthought? The ham-fisted attempts at iconic moments, like the diplomatic president who, after being taunted for his "â€¦mightier than the sword" philosophy, eventually stabs a villain with a ballpoint pen while shouting: "I choose the pen!" Yup, that actually happened--despite how hard the sound designers tried to bury it in the mix. But at least that moment was trying to do _something_ new. 

This is just another _Die Hard_ cut-and-paste_ _job. Even the title is lazy (another way that [Olympus Has Fallen proves itself a superior film][1]). From the self-narrating hero to hackers who cue up Beethoven music, _White House Down _is paying tribute in the worst way possible; by being derivative without being ironic. The tone is even insultingly mawkish, with spectators gathering outside the White House during a 9/11-level attack, cheering the military as if they're watching a rock concert. The film eventually devolves into a full-out comedy-- well, at least _I_ burst out laughing at the way the day was finally saved.

When everything feels fake, we're allowed to laugh. When things look great - like the wide shot of the crumbling Capitol building - we can't help but marvel. And that draws us in. There are a number of well-crafted moments in which the danger feels at least a little bit palpable, and in those scenes I can feel your work. But even Channing Tatum's undeniable charm isn't enough to bring the house down. Further down, I guess.
