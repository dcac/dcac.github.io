I’m so confused. When I saw your name listed as a “set educator” for _Neighbors 2_, I first assumed you tutored some of the younger actors. But I had no idea who, since there’s no one between the ages of 2 and 18 in the cast. Then I remembered Seth Rogan never actually graduated from high school, and thought maybe he was getting a real-life GED during production as an attempt to parallel the growth of his character. But that seemed unlikely.  And then I thought, because of your last name – Bible (ha ha) – maybe you were just a Sunday school teacher, brought in to show these lost souls the light. 

After all, there’s a familiar theme to the films and TV series you’ve worked on as a “set educator”: _The Apostle_, _The Leftovers_, _Thunder Broke the Heavens_, _Last Days in the Desert_. The list makes your inclusion in _Neighbors 2_ all the more baffling. In fact, it’s about the _only_ interesting thing I’ve taken away from the film. So I hope you at least found something redeemable here. 

Because God help me, I wanted to like this film. I _should_ have liked this film. I actually watched the first [_Neighbors_]() film twice, mainly because I wanted to experience it with my wife after we, too, moved into the heart of a university neighborhood with a newborn. And now, just a few years later, we’re trying to move out of said neighborhood, and away from the all-female neighbors that I actually had to testify against in court over a raucous party. In other words, I could have written the premise for this new film myself. 

Instead, I kept waiting for the jokes to get funny, for the characters to get interesting, and for the story to go somewhere. The film’s biggest virtue, I suppose, is the overt and constant reference it pays to gender politics. But it’s so ham and bloody-tampon fisted that it rarely manages to do more than inspire a smile. Right from the first sex scene, where Rose Byrne vomiting on Seth Rogan is anticipated from the first couple of frames, the film felt like it was coasting on auto-pilot. There are no moments that come close to paralleling the first film’s milking of an inflamed breast, which worked both as gross-out humour and a genuinely tense and (emotionally) relatable how-did-we-get-into-this-mess parenting moment. 

And then there’s the new characters. There was a lot of room to improve on the frat house actors in the first film, but really, the sorority sisters in _Neighbors 2_ are a sad sack of comedy. Based on the archetypes being played here, it’s clear the filmmakers watched _Pitch Perfect 2,_ but they obviously didn’t learn how to make the group dynamics work. Even the casting of Abbi Jacobson from _Broad City_ is treated more like a red herring for humour, where she isn’t given a single line or moment to indulge her comedic sensibilities. And in a time where pretty much every comedy show I watch on TV is centered on women (_Veep, Girls, Inside Amy Schumer, Broad City_) I found the lack of humour almost insulting. 

So fine, _Neighbors 2_ is far from the second coming I had hoped for. But please, next time you’re brought in to teach a group of comedy actors the Good Word, make sure they don’t forget how to use the bad ones.
