<p><strong><em>Dear Cast and Crew of Nashville,</em></strong><em> S1E02 &ndash; &ldquo;I Can&rsquo;t Help It (If I&rsquo;m Still in Love With You)&rdquo;</em></p>
<p><em>Episode synopsis:</em> <br />As Teddy&#8217;s campaign continues, Rayna is faced with an investigation that reveals family secrets. Juliette feels betrayed when she sees Deacon perform with Rayna. Scarlett must decide between her dream and her relationship with Avery.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Shownotes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>All of Hayden Panettiere&rsquo;s white, red and blue cut-off jeans by Susie DeSanto have me standing for America.</li>
<li>&nbsp;&ldquo;Ms. Sparkly pants?&rdquo; That&rsquo;s the best insult you got against a Rhinestone Cowgirl?</li>
<li>Rayna James&rsquo; signature song seems to be dropping one-liners and storming out on people. </li>
<li>Best (s)exchange of the episode &ndash; Deacon: &ldquo;This is not how songs get written.&rdquo; Juliette: &ldquo;No, this is what songs get written about.&rdquo;</li>
<li>Would love to be one of those weasels conducting a &ldquo;vulnerability study&rdquo;.</li>
<li>A man with secrets is easier to control, eh?&nbsp; Not if the man burns mysterious papers in a fireplace!&nbsp; </li>
<li>The fringes on Sam Palladio&rsquo;s shirt were the least offensive part of that standing bass, violin and electric guitar set. Yikes. </li>
<li>&ldquo;There is no us without you&rdquo; must already be an expression, right? Or at least a country song.</li>
<li>Connie Britton&rsquo;s singing limitations were woefully exposed in the final song. Music producer Buddy Miller might want to Milli Vanilli any upcoming ballads. </li>
</ul>
