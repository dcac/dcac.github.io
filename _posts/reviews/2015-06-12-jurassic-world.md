You’re the most famous palaeontologist since Ross from _Friends_. Which is kind of sad because you _actually_ a palaeontologist with years of under your belt.  behind-the-scenes presence in all the _Jurassic Park_ releases has a realistic-ish portrayal of what would happen if humans faced off against dinosaurs. 

I say realistic-_ish_ because you yourself admitted that you had to your expertise for the sake of entertainment which is admirable. It’s one thing to be a consultant about dinosaurs but it’s another to consciously suppress your  for the betterment of the movie. Although,  agree, velociraptors are scarier without the feathers. 

Don’t get me wrong; your most recent project, _Jurassic World_, was entertaining as hell. It isn’t everyday you get to see an alpha standoff between a genetically altered mega-dinosaur and a T-rex. My inner child pretty much passed out from excitement. 

But as entertaining as it was, _Jurassic World_ strayed too far away from being a movie about dinosaurs to being a summer blockbuster about “monsters.” 

 input the original trilogy was based on fact, but _Jurassic World_ had a new twist involving humans with gene-modification to create a new, enhanced species of dinosaur. what would happen if that dinosaur was raised in captivity only to escape and wreak havoc on unsuspecting tourists in a prehistoric-themed amusement park (same thing happened when I played _Zoo Tycoon: Dinosaur Digs_). 

It’s the type of ideal scenario for a classic Hollywood monster mash. hen our mega dinosaur loose in the forest and an elite team of soldiers in to contain it, the bloodbath that closely something out of _Alien_: lots of screaming and people being flung around. What’s the best way to show this creature is a force to be reckoned with? Throw some collateral damage its way. 

That type of arc opens doors for even more clichés, blatant and excessive foreshadowing, inappropriate moments of comedy and romance that strip away realism and predictable character growth.

I for one enjoyed the minor details: the velociraptors, using their hind legs to aggressively climb their prey similar to hungry hyenas, or the rotting teeth that can be seen when our antagonist dino sniffs out Chris Pratt. I would have liked to see more of that. 

_Jurassic World_ is entertaining. It’s a summer blockbuster. I get that. And as far as summer blockbusters go, it hit the mark. I had fun watching it, as did my girlfriend (who was there for Chris Pratt). I laughed, felt tense, and even jumped out of my seat a couple of times. If this is the trend that any sequel will follow, I’d be okay with it. I just hope if you are to be attached again, that you’ll have more of a say with the how the movie pans out. 

I’m sure the success of _Jurassic World_ will help finance your goal to bring [Chickenosaurus](http://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/paleontologist-jack-horner-is-hard-at-work-trying-to-turn-a-chicken-into-a-dinosaur/2014/11/10/cb35e46e-4e59-11e4-babe-e91da079cb8a_story.html) to life.
