<p>Sorry you weren't able to convince Denzel to get over Tony Scott. You did what you could, encouraging him to grow out his hair, brave a little grey--basically, to act his age. But it hardly makes a difference. Denzel still surrounds himself with epileptic cameramen and handsome whitebread co-stars., hoping to recreate that old _Man on Fire_ magic. _Safe House_ is a perfectly passable action thriller, but, in the end, it's a shame your modest makeover didn't last. At least you got to ruffle through Ryan Reynolds' dreamy locks.
