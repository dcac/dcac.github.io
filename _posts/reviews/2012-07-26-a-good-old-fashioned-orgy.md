I'm really sorry, Mr. Bader. If you didn't have a hard enough time living down that surname in grade school, I'm guessing this cast and crew completely wore you out. Did they pretend to flatter your camera-loading skills by calling you a "master"? Or did they just stick to "Handy Andy"? Either way, I hope they didn't hurt your feelings. When your name so easily lends itself to masturbation jokes, it's hard to resist the obvious. And being subtle is clearly not a strong suit for the people involved in _A Good Old Fashioned Orgy_.

That said, the premise of Alex Gregory and Peter Huyck's adult comedy is actually treated with more regard than the title might imply. Jason Sudeikis gives us a likeable party-hard who mainly gets off by showing others a good time. When his tight group of friends, entering their early 30s, realize they're headed different directions in life, he proposes an intimate encounter that will see their glory days go out with a bang. The month-long build up to the big event gives ample time to seduce the nay-sayers and shrink the go-getters' firm resolve. Some rather humorous research helps the men realize that they can't only focus on keeping up people's spirits, if ya know what I mean.

Luckily, the film does take shape at the end. Unfortunately, that doesn't excuse some of the flaccid and predictable humour early on. A good comedy, Andy, would have had you working overtime to capture the money shot when an actor was on a roll. Tyler Labine comes closest with some over-eager moments that ring true, but other times his delivery falls flat. None of the performances feel particularly fresh, although the story at least explores its concept with more conviction than _Hall Pass_. And against the odds, the climax doesn't disappoint.

You can also take solace in the fact everyone has probably grown up a bit, since the film was shot in 2008 and is only now (in 2012) getting a release. That's a long time for comedy, especially blue comedy, to be pent up. You'd think after all that anticipatory swelling, that the eventual release would have been an explosion of joy spread across the faces of America's youth. _Come_ on people! Doesn't sex sell anymore?

I know, loaded question. At least you can expect a lot of downloads.
