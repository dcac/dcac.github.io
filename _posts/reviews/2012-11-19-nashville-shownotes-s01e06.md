<p><span style="font-size:130%;"><strong><em>Dear Cast and Crew of Nashville,</em></strong><em> S1E06 &ndash; &ldquo;You&rsquo;re Gonna Change (Or I&rsquo;m Gonna Leave)&rdquo;</em></span></p>
<p><em>Episode synopsis:</em><br />Rayna seeks the help of a music producer to change her sound, Juliette goes on a date with an NFL player in an attempt to repair her image, and Lamar&#8217;s plan to delay Coleman&#8217;s arrival at a photo op works too well.</p>
<p><em>Original air date:</em><br />November 14, 2012</p>
<p><em>Shownotes:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>If the first thing someone says about your song is &ldquo;it&rsquo;s&hellip; different&rdquo;, take the hint. </li>
<li>@JulietteBarnes2 has 20,000 new follower &ldquo;requests&rdquo; after her monkey stunt? Well she only has 1,223 followers right now. She might want to loosen up those Twitter settings. </li>
<li>Do PR people actually set stars up on dates? <em>I feel so na&iuml;ve.</em> </li>
<li>This funky alt country song Avery is playing works well. I almost don&rsquo;t mind that he&rsquo;s such a spotlight whore, even as a vocalist.</li>
<li><em>Treme</em> alert! Don&rsquo;t be fooled, Rayna, that new &ldquo;it&rdquo; music producer is actually a street musician junkie from New Orleans!</li>
<li>Even if you look like Juliette, would any NFL player find it sexy for his &ldquo;fake date&rdquo; to chew him out on six incomplete passes? <em>I feel so na&iuml;ve.</em></li>
<li>I&rsquo;ll have to pause and zoom in on that &ldquo;Clean Campaign Pledge&rdquo; Teddy is signing. I only caught the word &ldquo;stereotype&rdquo; and might ask the show&rsquo;s writers to sign something similar. </li>
<li>Flying on a private jet to go nightclubbing in Miami? Believable. The fact this NFL QB can play Juliette&rsquo;s songs on guitar because he has a little sister? I used that excuse to learn a Bieber song once. No one believed me, either. </li>
<li>You have to love network TV naughtiness: &ldquo;Screw what? Rehearsing?&rdquo; &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Cut to shot of the cougar lady manager (Ed. Technically it&rsquo;s a <em>shaguar)</em> </li>
<li>Cinematographer Ross Berryman must have been dying to let loose on those <a href="http://motionleague.com/2011/03/cinematography-for-the-motion-artist-dutch-angle/#/vanilla/discussion/embed/?vanilla_discussion_id=0">Dutch angles</a> when Rayna gets drunk. </li>
<li>I shouldn&rsquo;t be surprised, but Rayna&rsquo;s new song just doesn&rsquo;t live up to all the hype she gave it. </li>
<li>Wait. WAIT. Deacon wasn&rsquo;t willing to &ldquo;pay the price&rdquo; of having a successful solo career because he would have had to sleep with the cougar manager? She&rsquo;s still a fox, 20 years later! (Ed. Too many sexy zoological references)</li>
<li>Now &ldquo;I&rsquo;ll-do-anything-to-get-ahead&rdquo; Avery won&rsquo;t sleep with her? This show is losing all credibility.</li>
<li>And now Scarlett is flying off the rails just because Avery had an option to sleep with her? She&rsquo;s severely less cute when on the crazy juice. </li>
<li>I&rsquo;ve heard of Stay-cations for budget conscious travelers, but &ldquo;hanging-in&rdquo; (vs. hanging-out&rdquo;) is a new one. We used to just call that sex. <em>I feel so na&iuml;ve.</em></li>
<li>Knock knock. Who&rsquo;s there? Avery. Avery who? The real Avery, who <em>is</em> willing to &ldquo;pay the price&rdquo; to be a star. A rather attractive price, I&rsquo;ll remind you.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>Closing comments</em>: Despite some hard-to-swallow plot points (or maybe these Southerners are as moral as they preach), the show is weaving a nice web of controversies.&nbsp; Episode six added a few new characters to the mix, and is finding nice ways to pair up the dramas (pictures catching people in the act, substance abuse issues, controversial song-writing partners, etc.).&nbsp; And once again, the show gave us at least one or two noteworthy new songs.</p>
