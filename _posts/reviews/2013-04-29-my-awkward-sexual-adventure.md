<p>Pierre Elliot Trudeau once famously proclaimed: &ldquo;There&rsquo;s no room for the state in the bedrooms of the nation.&rdquo; Typical Liberal, eh? Always missing the chance to make a buck.</p>
<p>Today, you (or <em>we</em>, the Canadian people) are investing in the nation&rsquo;s naughty business, then selling it back to the public (or<em> ourselves, </em>the Canadian people).Federal tax credits keep the film industry afloat and taxpayers agree to fund cultural agencies such as Telefilm, who, in turn, invest in movies like <em>My Awkward Sexual Adventure</em>. It&rsquo;s a funny system to be sure, one which has raised more than a few voices in the House of Commons (<em>Bubbles Galore</em> and <em>Young People Fucking</em> spring to mind).&nbsp; But the policy continues, panning for cinematic cultural gold that will enrich our lives.</p>
<p>Well, this film might not be it, but it&rsquo;s certainly not a complete write-off either.</p>
<p>Winnipeg director Sean Garrity trades in his typically quiet and introspective filmmaking style in order to bring this out-and-out comedy to the screen. He has, however re-teamed with his usual collaborator Jonas Chernick, who wrote, produced, and stars in the film. Safe to assume this type of creative consistency won their funding application a few points, but the bankable, formulaic script (and provocative title) probably helped, too.</p>
<p>Chernick plays Jordan Abrams as the quintessential Canadian loser-hero: a louse in the sack who can&rsquo;t satisfy his sex-starved girlfriend. Proposing to her only makes things worse, until a trip to Toronto gives him an opportunity to discover his mojo. After some occasionally amusing hijinks, Jordan meets your classic stripper-with-a-heart-of-gold, Julia (Emily Hampshire), and the two make a deal to exchange accounting tips for sex tricks. Boy will proceed to get girl/lose girl a few more times before the whole thing arrives to a predictable, but delayed, climax.</p>
<p>But like I said earlier, my goal is not to add to the moaning and groaning of culture-cutters complaining that the government is propping up Hollywood North. I actually found the film well done and a worthy investment of my time. <em>And</em> my money.</p>
<p>Chernick and Hampshire manage a distinct chemistry, which keeps the rom-com antics grounded. The few outrageous moments are also pretty successful (none more so than the fruit-focused lesson in cunnilingus). Awkward, yes, but also rather hilarious. And hey, it&rsquo;s not often the Government can make me laugh.</p>
<p>On purpose, anyway.</p>
<p>A satisfied citizen,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
