Pierre Elliot Trudeau once famously proclaimed: "There's no room for the state in the bedrooms of the nation." Typical Liberal, eh? Always missing the chance to make a buck.

Today, you (or _we_, the Canadian people) are investing in the nation's naughty business, then selling it back to the public (or_ ourselves, _the Canadian people).Federal tax credits keep the film industry afloat and taxpayers agree to fund cultural agencies such as Telefilm, who, in turn, invest in movies like _My Awkward Sexual Adventure_. It's a funny system to be sure, one which has raised more than a few voices in the House of Commons (_Bubbles Galore_ and _Young People Fucking_ spring to mind).  But the policy continues, panning for cinematic cultural gold that will enrich our lives.

Well, this film might not be it, but it's certainly not a complete write-off either.

Winnipeg director Sean Garrity trades in his typically quiet and introspective filmmaking style in order to bring this out-and-out comedy to the screen. He has, however re-teamed with his usual collaborator Jonas Chernick, who wrote, produced, and stars in the film. Safe to assume this type of creative consistency won their funding application a few points, but the bankable, formulaic script (and provocative title) probably helped, too.

Chernick plays Jordan Abrams as the quintessential Canadian loser-hero: a louse in the sack who can't satisfy his sex-starved girlfriend. Proposing to her only makes things worse, until a trip to Toronto gives him an opportunity to discover his mojo. After some occasionally amusing hijinks, Jordan meets your classic stripper-with-a-heart-of-gold, Julia (Emily Hampshire), and the two make a deal to exchange accounting tips for sex tricks. Boy will proceed to get girl/lose girl a few more times before the whole thing arrives to a predictable, but delayed, climax.

But like I said earlier, my goal is not to add to the moaning and groaning of culture-cutters complaining that the government is propping up Hollywood North. I actually found the film well done and a worthy investment of my time. _And_ my money.

Chernick and Hampshire manage a distinct chemistry, which keeps the rom-com antics grounded. The few outrageous moments are also pretty successful (none more so than the fruit-focused lesson in cunnilingus). Awkward, yes, but also rather hilarious. And hey, it's not often the Government can make me laugh.

On purpose, anyway.
