<p><span style="color:black;">The opening shot of Bruce McDonald&rsquo;s <em>The Husband</em> is clear: Maxwell McCabe-Lokos, the titular husband, is not in a good place. Hunched over, flinching away from eye contact. He seems like a nice enough guy, caring for his infant son, standing by his inmate spouse&mdash;it&rsquo;s only when we learn that her crime was sleeping with her 14 year-old student, Henry&rsquo;s demeanour suddenly makes perfect sense. Shortly before her release, as he struggles to cope with the damage inflicted on his life by his wife&rsquo;s actions, he spots the aforementioned 14 year-old. He is abruptly shaken from his stupor, and begins following the boy around, increasingly obsessed, as his life begins to unravel. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;">What struck me right away was the way, depending on Henry&rsquo;s state of mind, you contrasted action (or lack thereof) between foreground and background. Initially, as he drifts through his days shell-shocked and emasculated, he is stagnant. The world around him moves at a steady pace. Even when he walks or drives, there is a stillness to his presence. When he sees the boy and is jarred into action, triggering a frenzy of bad decisions, it&rsquo;s of a relief to see him become more animated. And to capture that relief, you change the depth of field; the action in the background slows down as his movements grow increasingly sharper and more erratic. This slow-speedy contrast goes back and forth throughout the film, and while it is an effective way of reflecting Henry&rsquo;s mood swings, it leads to a lack of momentum, or any sense of building up to something. </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;">The film has a strong beginning, and a few compelling moments towards the end. I just wasn&rsquo;t feeling much of anything in between. It&rsquo;s never really clear what Henry is trying to accomplish, and, by extension, what the film is trying to tell us. &nbsp;Sure, there are a number of factors contributing to Henry&rsquo;s breakdown, but they could have been woven into the narrative more effectively. Instead, we have a scene where Henry lashes out at his coworkers, and much later, an awkward scene with his teenaged babysitter that seems to have been the result of someone suddenly remembering, &ldquo;Oh right, we have yet to discuss the crippling blow to his masculinity.&rdquo; </span></p>
<p><span style="color:black;">It doesn&rsquo;t help that of Henry&rsquo;s two pivotal confrontations with the people responsible for his distress, one takes place too early, the other tool ate. If only McDonald and McCabe-Lokos (who co-wrote the screenplay with Kelly Marks) could have found the same balance between the foreground and background that you did. While there are some darkly funny moments, and a fine performance by McCabe-Lokos, there just wasn&rsquo;t enough depth and contrast to keep me engaged throughout. </span></p>
