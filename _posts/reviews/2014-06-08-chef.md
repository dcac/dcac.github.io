<p>When you took this catering job, you probably already knew that Jon Favreau was the film&rsquo;s writer, director, producer, and star. What you may have been surprised (and relieved) to learn is that, despite these many roles, Favreau is no chef. This isn&rsquo;t clear because he&rsquo;s an unconvincing actor (the man can chop!), but because he had the humility to include an end-credits outtake in which food truck chef extraordinaire Roy Choi teaches him how to make a grilled cheese sandwich.</p>
<p>Favreau admires how Choi slides the sandwich to the warmest parts of the grill and dotes over it until the buttered bread reaches a golden brown hue. Nothing fancy, nothing special. Just an old staple stuffed with expensive cheese. Just like this film.</p>
<p>The famous fromage, in this case, is Scarlett Johansson, Dustion Hoffman, and Robert Downey Jr., all of whom don&rsquo;t get 15 minutes screen time between them, though you can hardly blame Favreau for throwing in his favourite top shelf ingredients. The problem is, they&rsquo;re given thankless roles. Actually, less than thankless in the case of Johanssen, who has to look hungrily at the schluppy Favreau as he prepares a post-coital pasta. It&rsquo;s enough to make you lose your lunch.</p>
<p>This occurs when Favreau <em>isn&rsquo;t</em> hanging out with his other voluptuous love interest, Sophia Veraga. She&rsquo;s supposed to be his ex-wife, some undefined proto-celebrity (which makes her marriage to a kitchen chef even less believable), whose publicist wants a cut of that spicy Favreau-action after his Twitter war turns into face-to-face meltdown (and viral video) with a famous food critic named Ramsey (get it?&mdash;chef reference!). And thus, very slowly, we get to the meat of the story, in which Favreau starts his own food truck and tries to reconnect with his son on a cross-country trek.</p>
<p>Much to your delight, scarcely a scene goes by without food-porn close-ups or impassioned sermons about what cuisine really means.&nbsp; The missing ingredient, however, is comedy. Or character. Or consequence. In the same way Favreau&rsquo;s chef rebels against pandering to popular taste with familiar pleasures, Favreau the director seems determined to avoid settling on any one genre. The result, however, is less a re-invention of simplicity than simple blandness. Inoffensive, passable, but certainly nothing that would inspire cravings for repeated viewings. At least, no to my taste.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sending it back to the kitchen,</p>
<p>Christopher</p>
