<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><em><strong>Dear Leslie Mann,</strong> Actress,</em></span></p>
<p>I was sixteen when <em>The Cable Guy</em> came out. In the years that preceded it, there were two films that my friends and I watched obsessively and adapted into a form of shorthand, building from every memorized quote and reference and impression a <em>Nell</em>-like language that was probably indecipherable to our terrified parents. Those two films were <em>Ace Ventura: Pet Detective </em>and <em>Dumb &amp; Dumber</em>. In the summer of 1996, we lined up on opening night to see Jim Carrey&rsquo;s much-hyped follow-up in hopes of adding to our glossary.</p>
<p>But this letter isn&rsquo;t about the awkward silence that followed us home from the theater after we saw <em>The Cable Guy</em> for the first time. This letter is about you.&nbsp;</p>
<p>What I took home with me from that enigmatic, unquotable two hours was a crush on the sweet girl who played Matthew Broderick&rsquo;s reluctant fianc&eacute;e. Petite blondes with squeaky voices were a staple of the mid-90s (No Doubt&rsquo;s &ldquo;Tragic Kingdom&rdquo; came out the previous year, <em>Chasing Amy</em> would come out the next) and I fell in love with you in the innocent, perverted way that sixteen year-old boys do (it&rsquo;s all fantasies built from half-understood articles in <em>Cosmopolitan</em> and the graphic stories from <em>Penthouse Letters</em>). Is it weird to tell you that we&rsquo;ve shared a lot of romantic dinners, walks on the beach, impromptu ice cream dates, island getaways? And, you know&mdash;done other stuff?</p>
<p>(*change of subject*)</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s funny how distorted your sense of age is when you&rsquo;re sixteen. Whereas a seventeen year-old girl seemed so far beyond my mortal reach that I didn&rsquo;t dare cast her in my amorous daydreams, a woman in her mid-twenties seemed completely tangible, completely attainable. That we might end up together felt far more plausible than catching the attention of any girl a grade ahead of me.</p>
<p>And now you&rsquo;re forty. And the stress and strife and joy of those intervening decades is fuelling your performance in <em>This is 40</em>, your real-life husband&rsquo;s sort-of-but-not-really sequel to <em>Knocked Up</em>. It&rsquo;s one of those effortless performances that unfolds with such guileless control that it&rsquo;s difficult to accurately measure just how good it is. &nbsp;</p>
<p>It was probably a mistake to begin my letter with all that fawning. Because it&rsquo;s going to make what I&rsquo;m about to say seem completely baseless, like I&rsquo;m resurrecting a teenage crush in some awkward, transparent attempt to win your favor (that&rsquo;s only, like, 40-percent of my motivation). But I&rsquo;m going to say it anyway: your performance in this movie should be nominated for an Oscar<sup>&reg;</sup>.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Sure, everyone loves it when Meryl Streep wears prosthetic teeth and puts on a billowy accent, and, yes, it&rsquo;s terrific when Helen Mirren gives us that glassy glare from beneath the brim of a big floppy hat, and, no, I would never disparage Kate Winslet&rsquo;s unique ability to marry sexiness and severity in service of illuminating the horrific emotional aftermath of the holocaust&mdash;but there must be room, in the midst of all that crushing melancholy and self-seriousness, for a performance as poignant and carefree and honest as the one you give in this film.&nbsp;</p>
<p>In the course of <em>This is 40</em>, your character, approaching her 40<sup>th</sup> birthday and convinced that it&rsquo;s symbolic of some great (but ineffable) life-change, cruises through a British Parliamentary session&rsquo;s-worth of invective and name-calling, deals with enough interfamily drama to fill the pages of a Tolstoyan epic, and restrains enough despair to fuel a Panzer tank rolling into snowy Warsaw. The result is something so tonally perfect and nuanced that it almost transcends criticism; how do you judge someone for being a real human being?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Your husband Judd has made your mid-life crisis the engine the drives the plot, and that&rsquo;s irrefutable proof that you&rsquo;re his muse (by the very dictionary definition of the word: n. the goddess or power regarded as inspiring a poet, artist, or thinker). Instead of making your onscreen husband Paul Rudd &ndash; clearly his cipher &ndash; the center of the narrative, he has structured the movie around you. And throughout he gives you some of the best scenes, like the one in which, with the method-style bombast you might expect from a young Pacino, you unleash a torrent of verbal abuse on a bucktoothed thirteen year-old who has been harassing your daughter online. Or the scene where (spoiler) you&rsquo;re informed of a surprise pregnancy, and, with only your eyes, suggest a progressions through all five stages of grief in single ten-second stretch. It&rsquo;s a shame that the Academy has never had the acumen to recognize how special something like that is.&nbsp;</p>
<p>A film like <em>This is 40</em> is always the sum of its parts: individual scenes, individual gags, individual comedic beats. But here, knitting it all together, is your masterpiece. I&rsquo;m not sixteen anymore, and not so easily won over by simple cuteness and charm&mdash;but my crush has nonetheless been rekindled.&nbsp;</p>
<p>But there&rsquo;s really only one thing I want you to take away from this letter:</p>
<p>If for some reason it doesn&rsquo;t work out with you and Judd, you can totally call me. Just to talk or whatever. I&rsquo;m a good listener. Maybe we could go out for ice cream. Or get away to a remote island. Or other stuff. Whatever.</p>
<p>Sincerely,&nbsp;</p>
