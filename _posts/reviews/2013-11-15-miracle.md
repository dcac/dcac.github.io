<p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><a href="/letters/2013/11/15/miracle.html"><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/5005f6bcc4aa41161b33e89e/5329cf1fe4b07c068ebf74de/5329cf1fe4b07c068ebf7906/1384530131087/Miracle.jpg" alt="" /></a></span></p>
<p><em style="font-size:130%;"><strong>Dear Kamila Zlatuskov&aacute;,</strong> Associate Producer,</em></p>
<p>There&rsquo;s no murkier job description on a film set than that of the Associate Producer. How you personally earned this title, and what your responsibilities included, are anyone&rsquo;s guess. Maybe you&rsquo;re an up-and-coming big shot, or a bona fide number cruncher, or a valued creative partner, or a local string-puller, or someone the director just needed to pacify by slapping a label on you. If it&rsquo;s the latter (as is often the case), I&rsquo;m going to imagine you as a troubled Slovakian 15-year-old girl willing to do terrible, terrible things to get that title you desire &ndash; be it &ldquo;associate producer&rdquo; or simply &ldquo;girlfriend&rdquo;. &nbsp;</p>
<p>I really hope I&rsquo;m wrong. Drawing that parallel between you and Ela (<span class="itemprop">Michaela Bendulova</span>), the main character in <em>Miracle,</em> is far-fetched, right? Surely you would be smarter than selling yourself to human traffickers just so some asshole guy that you like can get himself out of debt. Because &ndash; spoiler alert for idiots &ndash; that might not go so well. Even if your plan is just to eventually &ldquo;escape&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Luckily, the way co-writer and director Juraj Lehotsky tells the story, I couldn&rsquo;t help but feel sympathetic to Ela&rsquo;s plight. Much like his main character, we as audience members are taken straight to a female re-education centre without any proper explanation. The resulting friction between the girls we meet there reveals more than enough for us to piece together what&rsquo;s ailing Ela. Her father is not in the picture, her mother (Katarina Feldekova) is tired of dealing with a troubled teen, and there&rsquo;s a mysterious man whose name is tattooed on her knuckles named Roby (Robert Roth). When Ela finds out she&rsquo;s pregnant, she runs away to find Roby, but he&rsquo;s hardly happy to see her, even before she breaks the news. In fact, she seems more like a forced-upon intern pushing for a full-time position than she does an actual girlfriend.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Still, my sympathy rested squarely on Ela&rsquo;s shoulders, since few other characters even register. And as the story skips quickly between scenes and seasons, brevity may be the film&rsquo;s greatest virtue. At 78 minutes, <em>Miracle</em> manages to make a strong enough impression to recommend it as at least a cautionary tale to young stubborn women. Which, again, I&rsquo;m sure you&rsquo;re nothing like.</p>
<p>Making false associations,</p>
