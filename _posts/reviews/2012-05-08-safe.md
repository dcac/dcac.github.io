<p><span style="font-size:120%;"><em><strong>Dear Mike Groner, </strong>Insurance Broker</em></span></p>
<p>Be honest: you must go into a cold sweat when you see a Jason Statham film come across your desk. Everything that makes his films work surely makes your job a living nightmare.</p>
<p>No other action star over the past decade has been so dedicated and single-minded in their pursuit of pure testosterone-fueled action heroics. Sure, <em>Safe</em> breaks the mold from time-to-time by offering us deeper moments of vulnerability, but only as a explosive counterpoint to what&rsquo;s next.&nbsp;</p>
<p>For me, it started early on when director Boaz Yakin used that long take to force, on cue, a tear from Statham&rsquo;s eye. We know he does his own stunts, but producing his own tears? Impressive stuff. At this point, as you first read the script, it&rsquo;s possible you believed you had a nice comfortable drama on your hands; nothing but standard liabilities to worry about.&nbsp; You may have even thought, as the narrative folds in a young Asian wiz-kid, that this generation was finally getting their <em>Cop and a Half</em>. &nbsp;Fortunately, you didn&rsquo;t get off so easy.</p>
<p><span class="full-image-block ssNonEditable"><img src="http://static.squarespace.com/static/5005f6bcc4aa41161b33e89e/5329cf1fe4b07c068ebf74de/5329cf20e4b07c068ebf7d9e/1336590439997/safe-2.jpg" alt="" /></span></p>
<p>The paternal instinct Statham displays for the film&rsquo;s code-cracking McGuffin (Catherine Chan) is designed less to show his vulnerability than to offer a purpose for his no-holds-barred protection of her. Such character development was just enough to keep me invested during the one-man war he wages against the Russian Mafia, Chinese Crimelords, and the corrupt New York Police force. From your point of view, sure, it&rsquo;s just a mounting pile of paperwork. But for the rest of us, I promise, it&rsquo;s much more thrilling.</p>
<p>The action pieces come hard and fast, brought to life by efficient choreography that helps the action feel exciting and (cover your eyes!) dangerous.&nbsp; The hand-held yet surprisingly fluid cinematography certainly helps make the risks feel realistic. By the time the mid-town shoot-out rolled around, I had to remind myself that equipment is just as liable as people on-set.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Man, you must have hated this film.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sure you learned your lesson. If you&rsquo;re looking to minimize damage claims, steer clear of any and all Jason Statham vehicles (including <em>actual</em> vehicles). He never branches out into family comedies or takes a romantic tangent &ndash; what would be the point? His career is perfectly <em>Safe</em> right where it is.</p>
<p>Danger is his middle name,</p>
