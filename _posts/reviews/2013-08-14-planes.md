I'm so confused. So, so confused. I just… I can't even… wow. I mean most people in the film industry have a few strange credits. Early gigs to pay the bills or gain experience are like a rite of passage. But your entire IMDb filmography is just… awesome. Editor on _Playboy: Wet & Wild_. Cinematographer on _Playboy: Sexy __Lingerie__ II_. Director of _Playboy: The Best of Pamela Anderson_.  Sure, it's a little "specialized", but so what? You're living the manly man's dream. But now this: _Planes_. In the world of _Cars_. From the creators of toys, and lunch boxes, and more plastic than even Pamela Anderson can tolerate. Dude, it's safe to say that this big-budget Disney film qualifies as the artistic low-point of your career.

I'm being serious.

I understand that this is a movie for kids. Young kids. Anyone over the age of 8 is probably going to feel like they're being talked down to. But come on. You know better than anyone that attracting adults matters. An intelligent joke here and there, a clever plot twist - anything to raise this unapologetically exploitive picture into something not so embarrassing. That's the whole _Playboy_ mantra. Unfortunately, that's not what you were hired for. Which is even more confusing.

Somewhere along the way you obviously learned something about aerial photography. Makes sense - there's only so many ways to shoot naked centerfolds before you need to get really creative.  So I'm happy to report that the aerial perspectives in _Planes_ are actually my favourite part of the film. Weeee! In some of the training sequences for this (painfully uninspired) race-around-the-world underdog story, the point-of-view holds long enough to feel like we're really following those exaggerated curves of a mountain or soft contours of a hill.

Hmm. I wonder where the inspiration for that came from.

There's just not much else here to enjoy. A few plane puns made me smirk, but never resulting in anything as drastic as a smile. And I have a kid now, I should be open to this stuff. But the advance screening of _[Elysium][1]_ was playing in the room right next door, dammit. I felt the way Ricky Martin must have during all his video shoots, surrounded by women from your films: sure, I'll do it because it's my job, but I feel sad inside. It's just not my thing. Why can't I be surrounded by _those_ people? My people. People like you.

Let me know when your career gets back on track. Those are films I actually want to see.
