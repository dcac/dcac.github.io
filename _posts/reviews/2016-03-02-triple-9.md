The first time I ever wondered _how the fuck did they do that_ _without someone dying_ was while watching _The French Connection_—William Friedkin’s gritty thriller about 70’s New York cops and their intersection with the heroin trade. The [scene in question](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2TVyJ-51jzc) involves Popeye Doyle (played pitch perfectly by Gene Hackman) careening down Stilwell Avenue in Brooklyn, chasing a hijacked L train, while driving (insanely fast) in a commandeered Pontiac. It is, arguably, the most intense scene of its kind ever filmed.

_Triple 9_ had more than a few of those kinds of moments. There were two extended car scenes that were phenomenally well crafted, and the rest of the film incorporated the kind of practical effects that make this kind of crime thriller grounded and pleasingly retro. _Triple 9 begins with a tautly choreographed heist that culminates in an insane chase onto a crowded Atlanta overpass. And your work shone through. In the same way that the above mentioned scene in _The French Connection_ completely immerses the audience in the moment—through sharp edits, great camerawork and most importantly, skilful and often dangerous stunt work—so too does _Triple 9_.

The rest of the film, specifically the parts where people speak, is more uneven. Director John Hillcoat has made a couple of great films—_The Road_ and _The Proposition_—and a near miss, _Lawless_. _Triple 9_ is more the latter than the former but it also suffers from a genre fatigue that particularly afflicts crime thrillers. Films like _Triple 9_ are (fairly or not) often held up in comparison to _The French Connection_ or Michael Mann’s _Heat_ or even something like _Live and Die in LA_—another Friedkin film and the one _Triple 9_ most closely resembles.

Part of the reason for this kind of close reading vs. what came earlier is that films like _Triple 9_ have a very specific pedigree: urban, often morally ambiguous, and deeply connected with whatever city it’s located in (this time a very well articulated Atlanta cityscape). _Triple 9_ is also filled with a kind of retrograde masculinity that is both compelling and weirdly out of time. This feels like a film that easily could have been made in the early seventies—which raises the bar substantially. Sometimes _Triple 9_ meets that gold standard, and sometimes it doesn’t.

This version of Atlanta is a seedy place, populated by authority figures that are only differentiated from the criminals by their institutional veneer. That moral greyness is multiplied by a whole slew of shifting loyalties that, unfortunately, also slow the film down. Still, _Triple 9_ has some great performances (Chiwetel Ejiofor, Luis Da Silva and Kate Winslet in particular), remarkable atmosphere, and a few tension filled set pieces. It just never really coheres as a narrative; there are just too many plot threads, especially for a genre that thrives best when it is laser sharp in its focus. 

_Triple 9_ does have more than a few memorable scenes though, even if all of them are kinetic and mostly dialogue free—including Casey Affleck leading a SWAT team in a breach. There is a _Silence of The Lambs_ night-vision-in-the-basement-tension to it that is completely effective. And it is in these moments that the film works best.

You certainly helped make those parts of the film thrum with a real threat and menace, Mickey, and because of that _Triple 9_ rises above the crowd. But just barely.
