Dear Readers,

Nobody gets into the movie business for the free lunches. You’re looking for acknowledgment – proof you made a small dent on the cinematic universe. And after five years (five!), anyone we _haven’t_ heralded or heckled on this site is clamoring to fill a Silver Stamp shaped hole in their heart. WE KNOW! Actors, producers, publicists, pee-ons – they all set their alarm clocks bright and early the day before we announce our awards. So stop feverishly refreshing your browser. Here it is, the on-screen effort that stood out the most this year – for better or worse. Thank you. And you’re welcome.
