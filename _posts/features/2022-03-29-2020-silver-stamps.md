We know - 2021 feels like forever ago. We’ve had war and convoys and variants and no shortage of drama to consume our lives. But we like to time our Silver Stamps as a counterpoint to Hollywood's golden statuettes, so here we are. A blast into the not-so-distant past and the movies that mattered the most - for better and worse.

Enjoy!
