They can’t all fly, can they?

For the second instalment of our **Worst Movies** **A-Z** series with [WatchMojo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg), we took on the weakest superhero films ever made. That’s right, even little old us felt like we could beat on these clunkers. Enjoy:

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="624" height="351" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/U7r9zeY3swU?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

As you can see, we gave ourselves some guidelines:

1. Worst film per letter
1. Skip articles in the title (the, an, a, etc.)
1. Big let-downs more likely to be picked

Proportionally, superhero films probably have the biggest budget of any genre. So the fun here is we’re always punching up. That doesn’t mean we completely ignored the early regrettable movies of, say _Captain America_ and _Nick Fury_, but we certainly weren’t afraid to also call out the movies that had every chance to succeed - in some cases, _multiple_ chances *cough cough” _Fantastic Four_.

Plus, they say failure is the best teacher, so here’s a bit of what we learned along the way: 


<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM WORST SUPERHERO A-Z</p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
		<img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-worst-superhero/worst-decade.jpg"> 
	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>WORST DECADE: 2010s</strong><br />
		Same decade as the Best Superhero films, actually, but that’s because they’ve just exploded in popularity. Which means the knock-off and cash-grabs are even more egregious. But don’t sleep on the ‘90s, where eight films made our list. That decade was a real superhero gong show, with nothing but failure (until <em>X-Men</em> in 2000 got the ball rolling).
      </p>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
		<img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-worst-superhero/worst-letter.jpg"> 
	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>WORST LETTER: G</strong><br />
	     Really, it just seems like a cursed letter. <em>Green Lantern</em>. <em>The Green Hornet</em>. Both <em>Ghost Rider</em> movies. The Russian abomination called <em>Guardians</em> is the worst of them all, but it’s a very high (low?) bar. <em>Guardians of the Galaxy</em> was only one to clear it - and an unlikely success, to boot.

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>Catwoman</em></strong><br />
		It’s maybe the first movie people think of when they think bad superhero movies, but know what we think of? Haller Barry in the cat suit. And that alone is more redeeming than anything you will find in the 1990 version of <em>Captain America</em>. <em>Elektra</em> also gets a lot of deserved derision, but it was only competing against the abominable <em>Elf-Man</em> for the “best” list, so them's the breaks.

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>Superman IV: The Quest for Peace</em> <strong>vs</strong> <em>Steel</em><br />
	  Shaq’s loathsome attempt at being a superhero off the court would fit very nicely on this list, if it wasn’t for the complete embarrassment known as <em>Superman IV: The Quest for Peace.</em> That Superman was truly too powerful to beat out of a Worst list.

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>Van Helsing</em></strong><br />
	    Is he really a superhero? Who knows. He super sucked in this movie. <em>Venom</em> was totally the right kind of bad, and the Internet would have exploded if we put in <em>V for Vendetta</em>. So, we got creative.
