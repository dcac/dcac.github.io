_**Dear Winners of a 2013 Silver Stamp,**_

Last year, the [inaugural Silver Stamps][3] hit the Internet like a shark-infested-tornado (there was really no name for it back then). Awards pundits quickly booked point spreads for the next [Awkward and Probably Racist Make-Up][4] Award, while the industry rushed to fill their scripts with more [Dramatic Use of Fart Noises][5].

But the Silver Stamp is beholden to no tradition. These annual prizes are an elusive and evolving distinction bestowed on only the most deserving recipient. We may take their bribes, but they'll never take away our freedom to do whatever the hell we want.

Enjoy.
