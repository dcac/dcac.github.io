Get ready to unleash the beast!

For the latest video in our **Greatest Movies A-Z** series with [WatchMojo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg), we’re looking at the ghouls and goblins and giant creatures that the movies made us believe were real. Enjoy.

As you can see, we gave ourselves some guidelines:

1. One film per letter
1. Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)
1. Final list should encapsulate the genre

We also got a bit more specific for defining what qualified as a “monster”:

1. No aliens
1. No vampires
1. No zombies
1. No demonic possessions

Zombies and aliens already have their own dedicated videos, while vampires and demonic possessions hued a little too close “human” than monster for our purposes. Plus, we want to give ourselves room to explore those options in a future video. 

So here’s some takeaways from our monster findings - one of the oldest and most successful genres in all of filmmaking history:

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>TOP DECADE: 1980s</strong><br />
		The peak of prosthetics and in-camera effects saw incredible remakes of monster movie classics and some truly frightening original visions that still hold up to this day. From <em>An American in Werewolf</em>, which inspired the Academy Awards to create a make-up category, to Cronenberg’s classic <em>The Fly</em>, to <em>Little Shop of Horrors</em>, it really was a monster of a movie decade.

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>BEST LETTER: B</strong><br />
		Completely unfair that we had to choose between movies decade-defining monster movies like <em>The Blob</em> (1958), <em>La Bete</em> (1975), and <em>The Babdook</em> (2014). But chose we did - and we went with one of the earliest, and best examples that the monster genre could evolve beyond cheap scares - <em>The Bride of Frankenstein</em> (1934).  	</p>

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>Jurassic Park</em></strong><br />
		Maybe an even more classic “monster” movie than <em>Jaws</em>, especially since their re-creation comes from scientists, but this Spieberg classic just had to play second fiddle to his original man-eater.

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>HARDEST CHOICE: <em>The Fly</em> <strong>vs</strong> <em>Frankenstein</em></strong><br />
		We had a way out of picking The Fly, since it made our Sci-Fi list, but we didn’t want to use that as an excuse to take off David Cronenberg’s master vision of transformation from man to monster. Plus, we thought Bride of Frankenstein was a pretty good 30s substitute - and arguably the better film.

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>Pan’s Labyrinth</em></strong><br />
	     An argument can be made that this movie shouldn’t count because the monsters only in the child’s imagination, and that argument can also be lost.
