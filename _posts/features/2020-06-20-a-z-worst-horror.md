s you know, the only thing better than a great horror movie, is a terrible one.

That’s why we decided to change gears in our **A-Z** series with [WatchMojo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg). This will be the first of a series of “worst” movies from A-Z for some of our favourite genres. What makes them “the worst”, exactly? See for yourself: 

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="624" height="351" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/MQEasibcQBw?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

As you can see, we gave ourselves some guidelines:

1. Worst film per letter
1. Skip articles in the title (the, an, a, etc.)
1. Big let-downs more likely to be picked

We changed the last rule from having a list that “encapsulates” the genre to one that prioritizes disappointment over sheer incompetence. There are no doubt a bunch of low-budget, student-made feature films that are objectively worse, but we care about movies, so subjectivity matters. Most of these films had a means to be so much better. Not all, for sure - but we tried to maintain a balance. 

Only two Ed Wood films allowed, for example.

But failure is the best teacher, so here’s a bit of what we learned along the way: 

<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM WORST HORROR A-Z</p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
		<img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-worst-horror/worst-decade.jpg"> 
	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>WORST DECADE: 2000s</strong><br />
		Just a total trash fest. The gory glory days of the 80s slasher were long gone, the 90s ressurgence ran its course, and the new wave of horror still hadn’t really hit. Instead, we got Uwe Boll. 
      </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
		<img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-worst-horror/worst-letter.jpg"> 
	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>WORST LETTER: H</strong><br />
	     <em>The Happening</em>, <em>House of Wax</em>, <em>Hobgoblins</em>, <em>The Haunting</em>, <em>Howling II: Your Sister is a Werewolf</em>, all the <em>Human Centipede</em> movies, bad <em>Hellraiser</em> and <em>Halloween</em> sequels - the list just never ends. We went with <em>House of the Dead</em> because it’s Uwe Boll at his worst (which says A LOT), but really - pick your poison. 
	</p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
		<img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-worst-horror/cheated-out.jpg"> 
	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>Birdemic: Shock and Terror</em></strong><br />
		<em>Birdemic</em> is the kind of purposely incompetent filmmaking we didn’t really want to reward - the kind of movie that tries to cross over to it’s-so-bad-bad-it’s-good territory. Like <em>Attack of the Killer Tomatoes!,</em> which never tries to be taken seriously in the first place.

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>Creepshow 3</em> vs <em>Cabin Fever</em></strong><br />
	   The remake of <em>Cabin Fever</em> was exceptionally disappointing, but <em>Creepshow 3</em> is an anthology film that had multiple chances to get <em>something</em> right. It didn’t, so it wins.

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>Zombie! vs Mardis Gras</em></strong><br />
	    This one actually does feel more like an embarrassing student film (with miserable attempts at comedy) than a properly funded feature, but it somehow got a version of a proper release, so it deserves to be properly shamed.
