We gave up on trying to create a single year-end Top 10 on Dear Cast and Crew long ago. And good riddance.  Critics secretly love these year-end assessments, as reductive as they might be. Ranking and categorizing films help us to not only define the year in cinema, but, in some ways, define ourselves over the past year. So feel free to puzzle together my personal psychology through my list(s), or just keep this page handy when you’re looking for what to see in the coming months – and what to avoid.
