I’ve made it a tradition to always post my top films of each year on Dec 31st , and more recently, to also break down my TV diet in an attempt to make sense of all my rabid media consumption. Except, unlike most people (without kids, I can only guess), 2020 actually saw a slight drop in the amount of films I watched (158 vs. 200+ last year, for example). But after the dark days of March and April, that mainly just has to do with less new movies being released. 

Let’s not kid ourselves. 2020 was a bad year for movies. And my #1 pick is unapologetically political - the film itself no doubt earned a [full extra star](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2020/9/2/tenet.html) just based on the conditions it was seen. Because at the end of the day, I don’t think a true five-star film was released in 2020. _First Cow_ was damn close, but in the end, I went with the film we already can’t separate from the year it was released - for better or worse. It’s _the_ movie of 2020 - and it’s awesome.

Also - since we’re all still home with most movie theatres not planning to release new films for months, I’m also including how and where I saw each of these films. With just a couple subscriptions, you can watch 90% of this entire list.
