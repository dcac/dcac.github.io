No one is really a fan of war itself, but films _about_ war? That's another story.

This is the second video in our **Greatest Movies A-Z** series with [WatchMojo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg), and it opens with a bang. Many of the other films are less obvious, but equally glorious (and/or horrifying), so strap in.

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="624" height="351" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/B5XQYYw-44w?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

Again, we gave ourselves some guidelines:

1. One film per letter
1. Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)
1. Final list should encapsulate the genre

The last rule dictated a lot of our hardest decisions. It also made for some heated debates, which only barely avoided becoming all-out fights. 

(Don’t worry. Cooler heads prevailed. Even if that goes against the spirit of the genre.)

So here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission.

<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM WAR A-Z</p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
		<img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-war/top-decade.jpg"> 
	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>TOP DECADE: 1960s</strong><br />
		Objectively, the 1960s just have the most films on our list (even if <em>X-15</em> is more about test pilots and the space race than actual war). But most of the others are iconic and run the full spectrum of the war genre, from terrifying, to rousing, to epics, to even a musical. The decade redefined the genre.

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
		<img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-war/hardest-letter.jpg"> 
	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>HARDEST LETTER: B</strong><br />
		Depending on your age, the first “B” movie you probably think of in the war genre is <em>The</em> <em>Bridge on the River Kwai</em> or <em>Black Hawk Down</em>. Or you could definitely argue for <em>Braveheart</em> (we stuck to modern war, even if we didn’t state that as a rule). They’re all A+ movies (not B-movies!) for different reasons. But <em>The Battle of Algiers</em> is still one of the most impressive films ever made. The White House actually screened it for Generals before invading Iraq to help them understand modern warfare. If you haven’t seen it, go watch it. Now!<br />
		<br />
		(Also, P and D were bloodbaths to argue between in their own right)

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
		<img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-war/cheated-out.jpg"> 
	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>Valkyrie</em></strong><br />
		It probably should be on the list. It’s definitely more classically a “war” movie than <em>Victory</em>. The only reason it isn’t here, honestly, is because we used it on our very first <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6vHljlgQsU"><em>Action Movies A-Z</em></a> before we changed the format of the videos. We didn’t want to repeat ourselves. But if this new series goes well, we'll probably redo Action anyway, and then really seem like fools.

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>The Great Escape</em> <strong>vs</strong> <em>Grand Illusion</em></strong><br />
		This one hurt. <em>Grand Illusion</em> was the first-ever release of the Criterion Collection. It’s a renowned piece of humanist anti-war filmmaking, which continues to age incredibly well. But it’s not Steve McQueen on a motorbike, and our dads would never speak to us again if it wasn’t included.

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>Come and See</em></strong><br />
	     It’s here because it’s devastating and underseen. Know what’s <em>not</em> underseen or on this list? <em>Casablanca</em>. Plenty of people will call it a war film, but come on. That’s not the shelf you’re going to find <em>Casablanca</em> on at the video store. You still go to the video store, right?
