Get your rotten tomatoes ready. 

For this instalment of our **Worst Movies** **A-Z** series with [WatchMojo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg), we’re looking at the most cringe-inducing comedies ever made. Seriously unfunny movies that tried way too hard and fell flat. Enjoy:

As you can see, we gave ourselves some guidelines:

1. Worst film per letter
1. Skip articles in the title (the, an, a, etc.)
1. Big let-downs more likely to be picked

No one should ever get their hopes up for a comedy sequel or prequel, but carrying the name of a classic still bears extra weight. And it’s also hard to find comedy bombs from before the 70s, since bad movies pre-VHS could truly disappear. But we did our best to find you the worst. 

But, as they say, failure is the best teacher, so here’s a bit of what we learned along the way:

<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM WORST COMEDY A-Z</p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>WORST DECADE: 2010s</strong><br />
		Comedies were an unexpected victim of the superhero blockbuster craze of the past decade, since mid-budget movies have all but disappeared. With the exemption of Judd Apatow and his acolytes, there has been little to cheer for - or laugh at - for the past 10 years.

	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
		<img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-worst-comedy/worst-letter.jpg"> 
	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>WORST LETTER: R</strong><br />
	    We love a good Rated R comedy, but starting with the letter R just seems to get funny movies off on the wrong. From <em>The</em> <em>Ridiculous 6</em> to <em>Reno 911!: Miami</em>, <em>RV</em> to <em>Repossessed</em>, the misses just keep on coming. <em>Rabbit Test</em>, directed by Joan Crawford and starting Billy Crystal as the first man to get pregnant, is particularly incompetent. And let’s not forget horrendous sequels like <em>Revenge of the Nerds II: Nerds in Paradise</em>. But the big daddy of embarrassment is still Sylvester Stallone in <em>Rhinestone</em>.	</p>

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>Norbit</em></strong><br />
	Eddie Murphy and Adam Sandler could have filled half the spots themselves, but we had to spread out the hate. And since National Lampoon’s has released so many terrible comedies, we needed <em>National Lampoon’s Gold Diggers</em> to represent the bottom of that barrel of monkeys.

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>Master of Disguise</em> vs <em>Movie 43</em></strong><br />
	  A lot of critics have a lot of hate for <em>Master of Disguise</em>, but the otherwise loveable Dana Carvey really doesn’t deserve so much wrath. Instead, let that burden be carried by the way-too-many movie stars in <em>Movie 43</em>, a complete abomination of cinema. It’s a comedy anthology film, and every entry is attempting to outdo the next in terms of over-the-top antics. They all fall flat.

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>Freddy Got Fingered</em></strong><br />
	    We know Tom Green’s first and only real directorial effort has its supporters. It’s a surrealist comedy where the point is to get off on other people’s disdain for the absurdity of the jokes. In which case, we hope those fans are happy it’s here. It’s midnight movie-worthy madness, but also an uneven disaster of a filmmaking production, that is hard to defend for anything beyond isolated gags.
