Dear Readers,

As consistent as a Roger Deakins Oscar nomination, as certain as a Roger Deakins Oscar loss, the Silver Stamps are back!

It’s the end of the year, awards season, and time to be left wondering “how could _that_ have won!?” Well, we have some good news. We’ve fired PriceWaterhouseCoopers, triple-checked the ballot boxes, replaced Warren Beatty with Christopher Plummer, and are absolutely confident that the names below belong to their respective categories.

After all, we have this thing figured out—this post marks the **1000th article ever published on Dear Cast and Crew**. Which means today we’re _all_ honorary winners.

(But here are the _actual_ winners.)
