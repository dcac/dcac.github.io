Dear Readers,

I feel like a bit of a failure. First, my personal top 5 films of the year are just a carbon copy of my top 5 from the Toronto International Film Festival. Also, more than half of the films on my overall list don’t have reviews on the site yet (by me or anyone else). Then there’s the fact I only saw four foreign films all year – and they all made my Top 10. Worse yet, in my chase for what’s new, I did a terrible job getting through the canon of great classic films and didn’t watch a single movie made before 1983. Yet my overall film intake was on pace from previous years (164 this year vs. 162 in 2017), so it’s not like the abundance of TV I consumed replaced all my watch time. Still, I’m going to include **my TV diet for the year below** in attempt to try and round this out, and also take solace in the fact I’m probably just better at curating what I watch (me and TIFF both!).
