You know they say: the fist is more powerful than… the bullet?

On film, at least, nothing gets the blood pumping better than some well-placed kicks and punches. So our latest entry in the **Greatest Movies A-Z** series with [WatchMojo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg) is sure to raise your heart rate. Enjoy!

As you can see, we gave ourselves some guidelines:

1. One film per letter
1. Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)
1. Final list should encapsulate the genre

The last rule dictated a lot of our hardest decisions. It also made for some heated debates, which only barely avoided becoming all-out fights. 

(Don’t worry. Cooler heads prevailed. Even if that goes against the spirit of the genre.)

So here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process.

	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>TOP DECADE: 2000s</strong><br />
		<em>Ip Man</em>, <em>Ong-Bok,</em> and of course the granddaddy of modern martial arts movies <em>Crouching Tiger, Hidden Dragon</em> (not <em>The Grandmaster</em>, that’s 2013) helped usher in a Asian action cinema become mainstreamed in the U.S. in the 2000s. They of course owe a ton to the Jackie Chan and Sammo Hung pictures of the 80s and 90s, but Martial Arts movies really become the center of culture for a while after that.

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>HARDEST LETTER: F</strong><br />
		Some people are probably asking what the F are we doing not picking <em>Fist of Fury</em>, but aside from our immunity to Bruce Lee mania, there’s just too much to choose from. <em>Fist of Legend</em>, <em>Forbidden Kingdom</em>, <em>Fearless</em>, and <em>First Strike</em> are all strong contenders. But hard to beat <em>The Five Venoms</em>.

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>OUT/NUMBERED: <em>The 36th Chamber of Shaolin</em>(1978)</strong><br />
		We could have cheated by using some of the alternate titles (<em>The Master Killer</em>, <em>Shaolin Master Killer</em> or <em>Shao Lin San Shi Liu Fang</em>) but we play our own rules here to maintain honour. Even if that comes at the expense of one of the greatest kung-fu films of all-time.

	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>The Raid: Redemption</em> <strong>vs</strong> <em>Rumble in the Bronx</em></strong><br />
		It’s hard to assess the impact the <em>Rumble in the Bronx</em> had on North American audiences. For many of us of a certain age, the film was our introduction not just to Jackie Chan, but to an entire new world of cinema. Yet <em>Rumble</em> hardly ranks among Chan’s best, and he is otherwise well represented on this list, so we had to go with new blood.

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>The Karate Kid</em></strong><br />
	    Either a no-brainer or a brainless entry, depending on your perspective. The action and inventiveness can’t hold a candle to movies like <em>Kung Fu Hustle</em>, but it’s also maybe had the largest American cultural impact of any martial arts film - one that continues to grow with the embarrassingly enjoyable <em>Cobra Kai</em> TV series. We just couldn’t wax it off the list.
