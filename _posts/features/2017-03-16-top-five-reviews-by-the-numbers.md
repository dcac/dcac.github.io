You have some explaining to do.

The following reviews, essays, lists and interviews have received the most traffic since we launched Dear Cast and Crew five years ago. For the next five weeks, we'll be taking the excuse to highlight some of our best and most-read pieces. We have over 800 reviews, dozens of special features, and more than few replies from the actual people we've written. Lots of great stuff to catch up on if you haven't read it before.

So let's start as objectively as possible before we start play favourites. These are the pieces that you, the readers, have been most attracted to so far:
