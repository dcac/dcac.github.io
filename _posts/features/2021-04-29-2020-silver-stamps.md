In a year with virtually no theatrical releases, and everything being released virtually, most award ceremonies have been hampered with glitchy broadcasts and awkward Zoom speeches. Not the Silver Stamps! We delayed the release to match the 2020 Academy Awards, but otherwise, you’re getting the goods we’ve delivered for the past nine years. 

Enjoy!
