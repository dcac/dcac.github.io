Get ready to either sing our praises, or start singing the blues. 

As we continued our **Greatest Movies A-Z** series with [WatchMojo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg), we had to do a Musical video. It’s being posted on their MsMojo page, where we hope to get a standing ovation for our choices. Enjoy.

The last rule dictated a lot of our hardest decisions. And it’s also worth remembering that these are best _movie_ musicals, not broadway musicals. So lackluster adaptations into the new medium won’t make the grade (sorry, _Rent_). 

Anyway, here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission. 

<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM MUSICAL A-Z</p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
		<img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-musical/top-decade.jpg">

		<strong>TOP DECADE: 1970s</strong><br />
		When you think Musicals, you probably think of the golden age of Hollywood, which pretty much died in the late 60s. And yet, the musical lived on - dare we say thrived - through the counterculture era of the 70s. It certainly had a revival in the 2000s after nearly going extinct in the 90s, and still manages to put out big hits every year today.

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>HARDEST LETTER: M</strong><br />
	      You’ve got <em>My Fair Lady,</em> which won eight Oscars. <em>Mama Mia!</em>, the most successful musical movie of all-time. <em>Les Misérables</em>, which was a huge critical and commercial hit of the most beloved broadway musical of all-time. And then there’s Moulin Rouge, which single-handedly revived the entire Musical genre in the 90s. But in the end, there’s just no toppin’ Poppins. Hopefully a spoonful of sugar will help that medicine go down.

	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>CHEATED IN: <em>Quartet</em></strong><br />
		Initially, qwe had The Who’s <em>Quadrophenia</em> here. Perfect, we thought! Then we actually watched it… and it’s not a musical. It’s based on an album by The Who, and only later got turned into a musical. So we emergency switched in <em>Quartet</em>. Which is about music and features singing, but not exactly in the spirit of a true musical (we know).

	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>West Side Story</em> vs <em>The Wizard of Oz</em></strong><br />
		Two titans of the genre. And if you’re voting for the best movie, you’re going with <em>The Wizard of Oz</em>. But for the best musical movie… we snapped our fingers and went to the other (possibly wrong) side of the tracks. It’s just too influential of a musical movie not to make the list. And we have another video coming soon that Dorothy will land in, not to worry.

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>Purple Rain</em></strong><br />
	     The only other real option here was <em>Pennies From Heaven</em>. That might fit the mold a bit more cleanly of a true musical, but we aren’t being purists with the inclusion of Quartet anyway. And let’s be honest, we can all use a little more Prince in our lives. Always.
