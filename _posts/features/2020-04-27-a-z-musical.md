Not all heroes wear capes. But in this case, it definitely helps. 

As you’ll see, we wanted to include superheroes in our **Greatest Movies A-Z** series with [WatchMojo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg). But pulling it off required some creativity. Did we save your favourite movie?  

<div class="video-container"><iframe width="624" height="351" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/tZSH0NASKRE?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe></div>

As you see, we played by the same set of rules as all the other videos:

1. One film per letter
1. Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)
1. Final list should encapsulate the genre

Think your list would be better? More balanced? Less heart-breaking? Let us know.
