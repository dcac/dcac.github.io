No one can watch everything, but for 2022 I created a “media diet” for myself to take in as many movies and TV series as possible, while still living a responsible, fun, and functional life:

- **365 movies**
- **52 seasons of television**

“But, why?” asked every member of my family. True, I don’t receive any prizes or accolades for these perverted (usually late-night) accomplishments - mostly the opposite. But the rationale for me is part math, part professional, part pleasure, and part academic. 

I like [clear goals](https://film500.wordpress.com/about/), and sticking to a film per day and season of TV per week, I could easily track my pace and plan ahead for times I knew watching something wasn’t possible. As someone who makes a living making film and TV shows, I also want to stay on top of what’s new and not be like the far-too-many people I know take pride in saying “I don’t have time to watch film and TV, I’m too busy making it” (_barf_ - yeah, I can tell). The pleasure part probably doesn’t need explanation, other than to say I derive even more pleasure in being organized and somewhat completionist in what I watch, rather than only watching things I’m predisposed to liking. And that leads to the academic part, which is to fill the giant holes I still have in film knowledge for classic, cult, and world cinema - not to mention the “greatest films of all-time” cannon that is always changing. 

Case in point: it was a strange gut-punch for the venerable [Sight and Sound poll](https://www.bfi.org.uk/news/revealed-results-2022-sight-sound-greatest-films-all-time-poll) to come out this year (once every decade) and declare the Greatest Film of All-Time to be not only a film I hadn’t seen - but hadn’t heard of: _Jeanne Dielman, 23 quai du Commerce, 1080 Bruxelles_ (1975) by Chantal Ackerman. Even after that kind of accolade, I might struggle to find time to watch a 3.5 hour ultra-low budget, Belgian feminist film with virtually no plot, no score, no camera movement, no dialogue for huge stretches of time, etc. But part of committing yourself to watching a film a day means you can stop putting off the films you’ll “get to eventually” or feel like you “have to be in the mood for.” Good movies get you in the mood every time, so here's the ones from this year that did that the best:
