**_Dear Readers,_**

Chasing awards is a fool’s errand. Just when you think AIDS is the new cool, ALS comes along and throws a bucket of ice water (and quantum physics) on your head. The lesson? Keep it fresh. Up the ante. No one wants to be last year’s disease. 

That’s our motto for the Silver Stamps. We can’t keep beating on the same ol’ _Man of Steel_ drum every year (though we would if we could). So here’s a brand-spanking-new list of winners and losers who helped define the last year in cinema.
