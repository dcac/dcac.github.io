It all comes down to this! Over the past 12 months, I do my best to see as many new releases as possible, with special emphasis on the ones with a chance at standing out. For 2016, that meant watching well over 100 films that were new to the North American market. Below are the movies I thought were the best, the worst, the ones worth seeing, and those that didn’t cut the mustard. A reminder these are personal picks and not representative of Dear Cast & Crew as a whole. I look forward to going to bat for my #1 pick in the next week or so. 

Let’s get judgey!
