You know what’s really scary? Committing to a list of the all-time best horror films. 

As the first video in our new Greatest Movies A-Z series with [WatchMojo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg), we knew it wouldn’t be easy. That doesn’t mean we knew it would be so hard. But here it is:

<iframe width="624" height="351" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/1iDnJOq_5yo?ecver=1" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>

As you can see, we gave ourselves some guidelines:

1. One film per letter
2. Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)
3. Final list should encapsulate the genre

The last rule dictated a lot of our hardest decisions. And we’re confident with where we ended up - especially after a last minute change to replace <em>Killer Klowns from Outer Space</em> with <em>King Kong</em>. 

(Seriously. We almost forgot <em>King Kong</em> was a horror movie. That would have gotten ugly).

<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM HORROR A-Z</p>

Now that this first video is out, here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission. 

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
		<img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-horror/top-decade.jpg"> 
	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>TOP DECADE: 1970s</strong><br />
		Nine of our choices come from the 70s. Every one of them has a sequel and/or remake. The decade really set the template for modern horror. 
	</p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
		<img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-horror/hardest-letter.jpg"> 
	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>HARDEST LETTER: P</strong><br />
		<em>Paranormal Activity</em>. <em>Poltergeist</em>. <em>The Purge<em>. </em>Pet Sematary</em>.  All extremely successful and important to the genre, but they ultimately have to bow down to the mother of mainstream horror: <em>Psycho</em>.
	</p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
		<img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-horror/cheated-out.jpg"> 
	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>Alien</em></strong><br />
		Is <em>Alien</em> a horror movie? Sure. But it fit better in another genre, so we didn’t even consider it here. Don’t worry, we can hear you scream. 
	</p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
		<img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-horror/best-battle.jpg"> 
	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>Scream</em> vs <em>The Shining</em></strong><br />
		If you think we’re crazy for not going with Kubrick, trust me: we get it. <em>The Shining</em> is a bona fide classic, and has had a real cultural resurgence since <em>Room 237</em>, <em>Ready Player One</em>, and <em>Doctor Sleep</em>. But <em>Scream</em> single-handedly rejuvenated the horror genre in the mid 90s. It spawned three sequels, countless imitators, and even a spoof series (<em>Scary Movie</em>) that got all the way to a fifth instalment. Not to mention how the original <em>Scream</em> still totally slaps as a horror movie. The best argument against it might be that we already have a Wes Craven film in <em>Nightmare on Elm Street</em>. But like <em>Scream</em>, we just had to play with the rules here.

	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>The Wizard of Gore</em></strong><br />
		Is it really better than <em>The Witch</em>? Probably not, but we had to throw some love at the buckets-of-blood king Herschell Gordon Lewis. Helped us round out the style of horror films on the list, too.
