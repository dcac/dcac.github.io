The thriller song might make you dance, but a thriller movie will have you glued to your seat. 

This list could rival any of our best genres in the **Greatest Movies A-Z** series with [WatchMojo](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaWd5_7JhbQBe4dknZhsHJg). It’s just non-stop great movies, including some recent Best Picture winners and all-time classics. Enjoy.

Again, we gave ourselves some guidelines:

1. One film per letter
1. Articles don’t count (the, an, a, etc.)
1. Final list should encapsulate the genre

And because we are starting to cover a lot of ground, we didn’t want too much overlap, so we gave ourselves a second set of Thriller rules:

1. No supernatural elements (see [Horror A-Z](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2020/4/20/a-z-horror.html))
1. No police as the main protagonist (see [Crime A-Z](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2020/4/24/a-z-crime.html))

So here’s some take-aways from our decision-making process. If your favorite movie isn’t in our final video, there’s a very good chance it’s a decision, and not an omission.

<p class="intro" style="margin-top:4rem">LESSONS FROM THRILLER A-Z</p>

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
		<img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-fantasy/top-decade.jpg"> 
	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>TOP DECADE: 1990s</strong><br />
		Technically, this was the first time we had a tie. We used six films from both the ‘90s and the ‘10s. The ‘70s and ‘00s were right behind with five films each. So really, it’s a nice balanced list and we went with ‘90s because the films just seemed a touch better, and more diverse.
      </p>
</div>

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
		<img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-fantasy/hardest-letter.jpg"> 
	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>HARDEST LETTER: M</strong><br />
	     How did we not go with <em>M</em> for the letter M? That movie is still incredibly tense and effective 90 years after it was released. But there was also <em>The Manchurian Candidate</em>, <em>Misery</em>, and then <em>Memories of Murder</em> by Bong Joon-ho (who is already on the list with <em>Parasite</em>). Ultimately, we went with the film that made Christopher Nolan a household name and the envy of every other filmmaker for years to come.

<div class="clearfix"  style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">
		<img style="vertical-align: top;display: inline-block;" src="/assets/img/features/inline/a-z-fantasy/cheated-out.jpg"> 
	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>CHEATED OUT: <em>Basic Instinct</em></strong><br />
		Michael Douglas plays a cop, so we screwed ourselves out of that one with the rules. Erotic thrillers are also their own special brand, almost a sub-genre, but it still hurts not to have the ice pick queen here. Although Sharon Stone snuck in with <em>Year of the Gun</em>, which she made the year before. So there’s that.

<div class="clearfix" style="margin-top:4rem;width:100%;">
	<div style="height:100%;float:left;width:40%;">

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>BEST BATTLE: <em>Duel</em> vs <em>Deliverence</em></strong><br />
	     <em>Deliverance</em> was certainly a bigger film at the time than a made-for-TV movie, and also cast a long cultural shadow. But <em>Duel</em> just keeps your heart pounding from start to finish and really proved just how good of a storyteller Steven Spielberg would become.

	</div>
	<p style="margin-top:0;float:left;width:60%;padding-left: 20px;">
		<strong>SPECIAL CONSIDERATION: <em>Verigo</em></strong><br />
	    It already made the Crime video, and you could argue that John Ferguson is police, but he’s a <em>retired</em> police officer - so there! And one Hitchcock film for the thriller video (with <em>Rear Window</em>) just wasn’t enough.
