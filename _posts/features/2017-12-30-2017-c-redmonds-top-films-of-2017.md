Dear Readers,

After publishing over [1,000 articles](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2017/12/20/2017-silver-stamps.html), I trust that Dear Cast and Crew is more than the sum of our lists. We try to appreciate the craft and characters behind-the-scenes that make movies magic. But at the end of the year, people still want to know what raised the bar for cinema writ large, and what failed to clear the baseline of quality control. So here we go.

BUT FIRST.

This year I’m including my full diet as a film critic. Not a list of the films themselves (could do that later, should I?), but a statistical overview of my cinematic caloric intake. Some personal metrics to help you gauge what kind of pool I’m fishing from. Because there may be an ocean of options out there, but let’s be honest: we’re all fishing from a certain pool.

And as always, this list represents my _personal_ highlights from the past year and does not reflect an editorial consensus from the other writers on the site. You’ll also notice we don’t have a review for my #1 film on the website, but my essay will be available shortly.
