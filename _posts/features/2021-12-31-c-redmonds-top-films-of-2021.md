Movies are back! TV is better than ever! You’re allowed to get excited.
 
Last year was a low point for entertainment (and society), but things bounced back with a vengeance in 2021 - omicron included, unfortunately. But it’s worth bookmarking this list if you’re looking to get out of the dumps. Most of these movies are already available to stream and rent, but so many of these films deserve the emotional boost they get on the big screen. I saw 46 movies in a theatre in 2021, every one of them probably earning an extra half star for the experience.

In terms of TV, it’s once again a gluttony of options from the major streamers (Netflix/Amazon Prime/Apple+/Disney+). But the highest batting average and bang-for-your-buck remains to be HBO/Crave. So keep that in mind when you’re allocating your entertainment dollars.

These lists are pulled from my seeing 235 films this year, and 58 full seasons of television (521 episodes). The Oscar eligibility window leaked into 2021 last year, so save for a few late releases, these are all fresh 2021 picks.
