Dear Readers,

Another cinematic year in the books, and maybe we’ve actually turned a page in 2018.

For the first time since we started the Silver Stamps in 2012, the world’s best living cinematographer didn’t make a film, leaving us unable to give Roger Deakins his Award for Excellence in Being Rogers Deakins (he’ll have to settle for having finally won an Oscar). But a lot has also changed since that time when the sky fell from a cloud atlas on a unexpected journey. Here are a list of the moments and movies we loved and loathed, the people worth praising and the half-ass efforts worth heckling.
