We&#39;d like to interrupt all this [fifth anniversary](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2017/3/16/top-five-reviews-by-the-numbers.html) [naval-gazing](http://www.dearcastandcrew.com/content/2017/3/24/top-five-reviews-personal-favourites.html) with some outside Top 5 submissions.

We asked some of our favourite critics to submit their Top 5 films released in the DC&amp;C Era (since 2012). Most of the below lists aren&#39;t ranked, but simply a chance for some trust-worthy fellow film nuts to re-laude the movies they loved in the past five years. So consider this a cheat sheet for deciding 1) what to (finally) watch, and 2) who else you can trust besides our own grab-bag of letter writers.

<u>**Peter Howell – The Toronto Star**</u>

_Moonlight_ (2016)  
Barry Jenkins brings a sensitive eye and compassionate soul to this story of a man&#39;s growing up and coming out. Exceeds all stereotypes as it reminds us of the power of great cinema.

_Son of Saul_ (2015)  
László Nemes&#39;s debut feature brings home the reality of the Nazi horror while also leaving much terror to the imagination.

_Boyhood_ (2014)  
Richard Linklater&#39;s masterpiece of form and content tracks a young actor from boy to man over a span of 12 years. You&#39;re watching real life unfold on the screen -- and it&#39;s like nothing you&#39;ve ever seen before.

_Inside Llewyn Davis_ (2013)  
The Coen Bros.&#39; uncanny evocation of the early &#39;60s New York City folk music scene makes for a wistful, wryly humorous and unforgettable film. A star turn for Oscar Isaac.

_Holy Motors_ (2012)  
A marvelous mystery tour to mourn and celebrate cinema. Leos Carax zooms us through one Paris day and a lifetime of movies, transported by a white limo and the chameleon Denis Lavant.

<u>**Adam Kempenaar – Filmspotting**</u>

[_The Master_](https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/filmspotting?selected=FLM3205811264) (2012)  
At its core a tale of two men struggling to express and accept their love for each other, which we see throughout PTA&#39;s work – including, of course, the father-son relationship in &quot;There Will Be Blood. His films are populated with people struggling to be self-made men, determined to assert their identities by whatever means necessary. Some succeed, but at what cost to their humanity? Anderson is the supreme chronicler of the 20th century American experience.

[_Inside Llewyn Davis_](https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/filmspotting?selected=FLM9617803346) (2013)  
The Coens are masters at exploring fundamental existential questions free of moralizing. Their characters struggle with mortality (time and the passage of time is referenced constantly in ILD), their place in the world, the choices they make, and the consequences of the choices they make (or don&#39;t make). Llewyn is a bastard, but a bastard who is legitimately blessed with a gift that the world doesn&#39;t want or need, which makes him a tragic misfit.

[_Boyhood_](https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/filmspotting?selected=FLM4225364072) (2014)  
Captures how life is about recognizing the magic in the mundane. We&#39;re always in the midst of &#39;next steps&#39;, segues and transitions, not grand transformative experiences, and Linklater here has pulled off one of the great cinematic tricks. He presents a coming of age story where someone actually comes of age before our eyes – an experience only a movie can offer.

[_The Big Short_](https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/filmspotting?selected=FLM6014497121) (2015)  
A (frequently hilarious) crime movie where the American economy is the corpse, the entire financial system is the culprit, and the detectives all have bets on the body dropping.

[_Tower_](https://cms.megaphone.fm/channel/filmspotting?selected=FLM4343198340) (2016)  
Simply the most thrilling, terrifying, intense and ultimately moving 96 minutes I spent watching movies in 2016. Director Keith Maitland combines archival footage and rotoscoped recreations to put us in the middle of the chaos on that August day in 1966 when a sniper went to the top of the tower at the University of Texas campus and opened fire. Immersing the viewer in the harrowing, essentially real-time experience, there was the potential to perhaps exploit the victims&#39; trauma, but Maitland is too sensitive a filmmaker and too interested in the personal connections and courage on display that day. He doesn&#39;t make a single misguided choice with the material.

<u>**Geoff Pevere – Critic/Author (Globe and Mail/ &quot;Mondo Canuck&quot;/ &quot;Toronto on Film&quot;)**</u>

_The Act of Killing_ (2012)  
Joshua Oppenheimer&#39;s documentary about men living with the deaths they perpetrated as part of the Indonesian state killing squads is as harrowing as it is unprecedented: Oppenheimer records these defiantly unrepentent killers making movie versions of their own crimes, and the often jaw-dropping results only magnify the horror of what really happened by providing such a bizarre fictional projection of self-rationalizing evil.

_It Follows_ (2014)  
David Robert Mitchell&#39;s deftly eerie teen-horror convention mashup may evoke John Carpenter in its basic narrative and selected technical elements, but it&#39;s far more interested in the dynamics of adolescent anxiety and the disorienting shadow-play between nightmare and consciousness. So Carpenter yes, but Kubrick too, and on a Dollarama budget.

_John Wick_ (2014)  
The classic grindhouse revenge movie reconfigured as a neo-Hong Kong comic book art movie. Striking a truly delicate balance between geeky self-referentiality and respectfully visceral red-meat action ritual, Chad Stahelski and David Leitch&#39;s movie about a retired contract killer (Keanu Reeves, brilliantly cast as a human club) drawn reluctantly back into the fray when his car is stolen and dog killed is only as smart as you need it to be. Which is to say you can admire its considerable cinematic savvy or just dig the ass-kicking.

_Under the Skin_ (2013)  
In Jonathan Glazer&#39;s brilliantly unnerving science fiction noir, an alien entity (having taken the almost-human form of Scarlett Johansson) trolls the Scottish countryside for men to harvest. Her mission is complicated by the intrusion of empathy for her victims, the film&#39;s sole flicker of hope in an otherwise black universe.

_O.J.: Made in America_ (2016)  
Ezra Edelson&#39;s justly-celebrated non-fiction epic about the insinuating spectre of race in American culture and politics, unfolding as a riveting true-crime procedural on the one hand, but on the other providing as balanced, comprehensive and incisive an account of how (and why) O.J. became the unlikeliest symbol of racial inequity to ever came out of Brentwood.

<u>**Chris Knight – The National Post**</u>

[_Arrival_](http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/movies/arrival-will-make-you-feel-like-youre-seeing-colour-for-the-first-time-while-expanding-your-perception-of-family) (2016)  
This is easily my favourite film of the last five years; a science-fiction head-scratcher with a real human heart, embodied in Amy Adams&#39; nuanced performance. It reduced me to tears, which not many movies can do.

[_Hell or High Water_](http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/movies/from-nick-caves-score-to-ben-foster-and-chris-pines-chemistry-theres-much-to-love-in-hell-or-high-water) (2016)  
Screenplay, casting, acting, music, cinematography – this deceptively simple &quot;bank robber&quot; movie transcends the genre, and gets everything right.

[_Paterson_](http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/movies/i-urge-you-to-be-its-shadow-jim-jarmuschs-paterson-is-pure-poetry) (2016)  
Jim Jarmusch takes the life of a poet and somehow turns it into a film that is also a poem, complete with stanzas, internal rhyme and subtle metaphor.

[_Star Wars: The Force Awakens_](http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/movies/star-wars-the-force-awakens-review-j-j-abrams-crafts-loving-homage-to-original-saga) (2015)  
It isn&#39;t easy to revisit one of the most influential movies ever; even George Lucas couldn&#39;t manage it with Episodes one through three. But this return to a galaxy far away reinvigorates the franchise perfectly.

[_Boyhood_](http://news.nationalpost.com/arts/movies/boyhood-reviewed-richard-linklaters-18-year-opus-is-the-cinematic-experience-of-a-lifetime) (2014)  
Almost defies description. Richard Linklater tells the story of a boy becoming a man, guided by parents, a sister and friends, but ultimately on his own path. Aren&#39;t we all?

** **

<u>**Richard Crouse – CTV/CP24 /RichardCrouse.ca**</u>

_Boyhood_ (2014)  
A moving experience about the individual moments that make a life.

_Frances Ha_ (2013)  
It feels more intimate and raw than the usual twenty-ish crisis flick and with each detail we get another piece of the puzzle that makes up Frances&#39; life.

_Stories We Tell_ (2012)  
What could have been a self-indulgent home movie is, instead, a riveting look into the dynamics of a group of individuals bound together by birth and circumstance.

_Exit Through The Gift Shop_ (2013)  
An engrossing movie about the creation of art, the exploitation of art and the meaning of art.

_Inside Llewyn Davis_ (2013)  
Imagine the cover of &quot;The Freewheelin&#39; Bob Dylan&quot; come to life.

** **

<u>**Jay Stone – Ex-Press.ca**</u>

_Boyhood_ (2014)  
Moving, insightful, and also a feat of incredible technical achievement by director Richard Linklater. It&#39;s sacrilege, I know, but I found this to be a more authentic coming-of-age story than Moonlight.

_12 Years A Slave_ (2013)  
It was very difficult to watch, but it presented the facts of American slavery — not just as a lesson in cruelty, but also as a dark illustration of the violent foundation of the country itself — with unblinking clarity. Devastating.

_Room_ (2015)  
Devastating for a different reason. A woman is locked in a shed by her abductor who fathers her child (an amazing performance by Canadian Jacob Tremblay). To the boy, the shed, which he calls &quot;room,&quot; is the entire world. It&#39;s almost science fiction, except scarier.

[_Manchester by the Sea_](http://www.ex-press.ca/2016/11/29/lines-delicate-t%E2%80%A6y-manchester-sea/) (2016)  
Kenneth Lonergan&#39;s return to cinema is a bleak drama about a man (Oscar winner Casejy Affleck) who must revisit his former life to discover a tragedy he created. A heartbreaking story told with an exemplary lack of sentiment.

_La La Land_ (2016)  
Yeah, I know, but it thrilled me (even more the second time), and despite some hiccups in the musical numbers, I just loved the opening scene and the brilliant final sequence.

<u>**Tara Thorne – The Coast.ca**</u>

[_Frances Ha_](http://www.thecoast.ca/halifax/frances-ha/Content?oid=3936404) (2012)  
Greta Gerwig has redefined American acting with her naturalistic performances, not clawing her way out of the limiting mumblecore world but tap-dancing with charm and aplomb. She&#39;s done most of her best work in the past five years—_Mistress America, Maggie&#39;s Plan, 20th Century Women_—but Frances is so far her masterwork, a beautiful mess of a girl blindly dancing her way across New York City.

_Before Midnight_ (2013)  
_Boyhood_ gets all the accolades but Linklater—and his stars, Julie Delpy and Ethan Hawke—spent even more time on three films chronicling the spark and flicker of a full relationship. _Boyhood_&#39;s a better gimmick, but the _Before_s are better movies, including this fierce, truthful conclusion, which finds Celine and Jesse worn and weathered but still caring for the flame lit on that first night in Vienna.

[_Enough Said_](http://www.thecoast.ca/halifax/enough-said/Content?oid=4091479) (2013)  
Nicole Holofcener is one of our least appreciated but best directors. Every movie she&#39;s made—just five in total—is an eminently watchable character study, centred on not-always-likable women staring down their lives. _Enough Said_ pulls a gentle performance from the late James Gandolfini, but it&#39;s remarkable because it offers Julia Louis-Dreyfus her first starring film role (ever!) and gives her shades we&#39;ve never seen her play before.

_The Heat_ (2013)  
_The Heat_&#39;s toss-off plot is nowhere near the point. Sandra Bullock does capital-A acting in _Gravity_ but this kind of material—the uptight cop forced to unravel—is where her charm and wit shine brightest. It also cements Melissa McCarthy as one of the most vital performers of the past decade, her foul-mouthed gonzo fearlessness Bullock&#39;s perfect foil. I would watch 10 bad _Heat_ sequels.

 [_Spotlight_](http://www.thecoast.ca/halifax/review-truth-and-spotlight/Content?oid=5069445) (2015)  
Journalists love _Spotlight_ because it shows us in our natural environment—windowless, pizza-stained, poorly clothed and coiffed. But really it&#39;s a procedural cop drama in the form of an historical newspaper investigation—one that uncovered the Catholic Church&#39;s deepest secrets. A terrific ensemble—Mark Ruffalo and Rachel McAdams leading the team—makes an the nuts and bolts of an inherently uninteresting thing (reporting) as riveting as a high-stakes sports match.

<u>**Thom Ernst – CBC / Making Movies (TV1) / This Movie&#39;s About You (podcast)**</u>

_Moonlight_ (2016)  
It&#39;s the most recent one that had any real impact on me - although a documentary from Toronto&#39;s Hugh Gibson had a similar affect.  Both films took everything I thought I knew about Urban drug culture and slapped some sense into me.

_Boyhood_ (2014)  
Screw the backlash.  This film is one of the most important films to be released- and not because it took 12 years to make - that&#39;s just the hook on which the promotion department hangs the lure. The film is not so much about being a boy (or a girl, for the film need not be gender specific) but about what it means to be an adult - and how we get to where we&#39;re going.  Every little moment, the significant ones, the open ended ones, the easy to forget ones, all help to shape who we become. I think I&#39;m a reasonably good father, uncle, friend and neighbour - but after this movie I vowed to be even more aware of my interaction with young people recognizing that even the smallest of interactions can have a lasting affect.

_The Overnighters_ (2014)  
A documentary worthy of John Steinbeck with an ending equal to anything concocted by Todd Haynes.

_Her_ (2013)  
A film that shouldn&#39;t work but does.  I might have edited out the sex-via-computer scene which seemed to push the element of techno-love a bit too far - but the rest of the film is believable mostly because of Spike Jonze direction and Phoenix&#39;s subdued performance.  I have never looked at my laptop the same since.

_The Lego Movie_ (2014)  
Written by the same dudes who gave us _22 Jump Street_ and _Freaks &amp; Geeks_.  Self-referential (self-critical) and highly entertaining.  It marks the first time my daughter left the theatre quoting her favourite lines.  Moves briskly from opening scene to the last.  Ironic, and yet still wraps up with a good-old fashion family message.

<u>**Carsten Knox – Flaw in the Iris**</u>

[_A Separation_](http://www.thecoast.ca/halifax/a-separation-is-brilliant/Content?oid=3035719) (2012)  
I&#39;m a latecomer to the work of Asghar Farhadi, but I loved how this film&#39;s momentum reached escape velocity in three acts. It goes from a domestic drama to courtroom thriller, a fascinating look at the inequities of Iranian society.

[_Ex Machina_](http://halifaxbloggers.ca/flawintheiris/2015/05/ex-machina-review-stylish-essential-science-fiction/) (2014)  
A _Bride of Frankenstein_ for the 21st Century, Alex Garland&#39;s artificial intelligence drama cooks along with the best of Charlie Brooker&#39;s _Black Mirror,__ _a slab of tech anxiety served up on a prickly bed of male assumptions.

[_Mad Max: Fury Road_](http://halifaxbloggers.ca/flawintheiris/2015/05/mad-max-fury-road-review-a-masterpiece-in-speed-and-metal/) (2015)  
Pure adrenalized vehicular badassery. No action movie in living memory has been as much fun, with the especially welcome addition of socio-political thought amidst the pistons and polecats.

[_Personal Shopper_](http://halifaxbloggers.ca/flawintheiris/2016/09/aff2016-personal-shopper-american-honey-operation-avalanche-review/) (2016)  
Just squeezing in under the wire---it opens soon in Halifax---Olivier Assayas new picture gives Kristen Stewart a restless, fidgety vehicle highlighting her restless, fidgety presence. It breaks all kinds of genre rules by refusing to commit, but despite that it&#39;s still great. Maybe because.

[_Stories We Tell_](http://www.thecoast.ca/halifax/stories-we-tell/Content?oid=3450783) (2012)  
Sharper eyes than mine caught Sarah Polley&#39;s fictionalized conceit from the first act, but I was fooled in the most wonderful way. Rarely has such a personal film mixing documentary with drama managed to feel both authentic and universal.

<u>**Greg Klymkiw – The Film Corner** </u>

[_The Act of Killing_ (2012)](https://klymkiwfilmcorner.blogspot.ca/2013/07/the-act-of-killing-review-by-greg.html)  
This work&#39;s importance as art is matched only by its truly formidable significance as a document of humanity/inhumanity amidst a collection of the most repugnant individuals ever profiled in any film. Focusing upon several notorious members of a Indonesian death squad who committed unspeakable acts of torture and murder almost fifty years ago, we witness, our jaws to the floor, as these men continue to live - free, wealthy and revered as heroes. They not only discuss their activities in detail, they do so with pride. Director Joshua Oppenheimer then allows them to recreate their horrors dramatically. This is an iron-clad guarantee. You have not seen, nor will you EVER see a movie like _The Act of Killing_.

[_God Knows Where I Am_ (2016)](https://klymkiwfilmcorner.blogspot.ca/2016/05/god-knows-where-i-am-hot-docs-2016.html)  
With _God Knows Where I Am_, directors Todd and Jedd Wider deliver a poetic documentary infused with the sublime. Elegiacally charting the final weeks of middle-aged Linda Bishop, found dead in a New Hampshire farmhouse, we experience gorgeously-composed, exquisitely-lit Vilmos-Zsigmond-like dollies and tracking shots within the real location. Accompanied by actress Lori Singer&#39;s off-camera readings from Bishop&#39;s actual journal, we learn she existed on rainwater and apples. Trapped by fear, she embraced the comfort afforded by loneliness. As the apples ran out, the unheated house battered by the coldest winter in New Hampshire history; comfort gave way to agony and ultimately, to a state of grace. Interspersed by interviews with her daughter, friends, a policeman and medical examiner, then most heartbreakingly, 8mm movies of Bishop as a child - once happy and full of promise - profoundly poetic truths about mental illness are rendered with an oh-so terrible, terrible beauty.

[_The Great Beauty_ (2013)](https://klymkiwfilmcorner.blogspot.ca/2014/04/the-great-beauty-criterion-blu-ray.html)  
With _The Great Beauty_, director Paolo Sorrentino is clearly paying homage to Federico Fellini&#39;s _La Dolce Vita_ (with dollops of _8 1/2_), but this is no mere nod to cinematic mastery (one which might even be working at a subconscious level) - he explores a world the late maestro visited half-a-century ago and uses it as a springboard into contemporary Italy and most importantly, as a flagrantly florid rumination upon the decline of culture, the long-ago loss of youthful ideals and the deep melancholy rooted in an old man seeking answers as to why the woman he loved left him behind to his own devices. Set against the backdrop of a historic Rome in ruins, the empire that fell so mightily, we&#39;re plunged into a dizzying nocturnal world as blank and vacant as the eyes of a ruling class that rules nothingness.

[_Hurt_ (2015)](https://klymkiwfilmcorner.blogspot.ca/2015/08/hurt-review-capsule-by-greg-klymkiw.html)  
During the 1980s, 18-year-old Steve Fonyo ran 8000 km across Canada with a prosthetic leg. Raising $14 million for cancer research, he received the Order of Canada. After suffering three decades from abject poverty and various addictions within the dark underbelly of the criminal class, this Canadian Hero was transformed into a pariah by pencil-pushers in the nation&#39;s capitol and turfed from the country&#39;s highest recognition. _HURT_ has its masterpiece status guaranteed. Charting one year in Fonyo&#39;s life, Alan Zweig pulls off a miracle. This stunning documentary is as narratively searing and artistically compelling as the grim and gritty 70s cinematic forays into crime, punishment and atonement, not unlike Martin Scorsese&#39;s _Raging Bull_ and Peter Yates&#39;s _The Friends of Eddie Coyle_. The very process of filmmaking and Zweig&#39;s intervention as both artist and humanitarian offers the promise of healing and redemption. The picture cold-cocks you as frequently as it wrenches tears.

[_Kumiko The Treasure Hunter_ (2014)](https://klymkiwfilmcorner.blogspot.ca/2014/10/kumiko-treasure-hunter-review-by-greg.html)  
_Fargo_, the movie by the Coen Brothers, is not just an instrument which inspires the title character&#39;s desires, it&#39;s Kumiko&#39;s very soul and represents an ethos of both America and madness. Kumiko is no mere stranger in a strange land, but a stranger in her _own_ land who _becomes_ a stranger in a strange land - a woman without a country save for that which exists in her mind. There isn&#39;t a false note to be found in this gorgeously acted, directed and photographed movie. It is not without humour, but none of it is at Kumiko&#39;s expense and when the film slowly slides into full blown tragedy, the Zellners (director David and writer Nathan) surround Kumiko in the ever-accumulating high winds and snow under the big skies of Minnesota. We get, as she does, a bittersweet taste of happiness - a dream of triumph, a dream of reunion, a dream of peace, at last.

<u>**Patrick Mullen – POV Magazine /**  **cinemablographer.com**</u>

[_Wild_](http://www.cinemablographer.com/2014/09/tiff-review-wild.html)  
Jean-Marc Vallée&#39;s kaleidoscopic take on Cheryl Strayed&#39;s memoir is an exhilarating and moving spiritual journey. This is how you do a great adaptation.

[_Stories We Tell_](http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/stories-we-tell/)  
Sarah Polley&#39;s intimate and shapeshifting documentary mines family hiistory to find a universal truth within a personal tale. There&#39;s no better example for the value of telling our own stories.

[_Anna Karenina_](http://www.cinemablographer.com/2012/09/tiff-review-anna-karenina.html) - Joe Wright&#39;s adaptation of Tolstoy&#39;s classic novel is an audacious fusion of film and theatre. If all the world&#39;s a stage in _Anna Karenina_, then the cast and crew should take a well-deserved bow.

[_Mommy_](http://www.cinemablographer.com/2014/09/tiff-review-mommy.html) - Dolan truly hit his stride with _Mommy_. That he made such a great film only at the age of twenty-five, well, only makes _Mommy_ all the more impressive. Take that, Orson Welles!

[_Youth_](http://www.cinemablographer.com/2015/09/tiff-review-youth.html) - Built on a series of repetitions and exquisitely-shot set pieces by Luca Bigazzi, _Youth_ conveys that aging is simply all in the mind as one can either look forward or look back, and either be burdened by the past or be revitalized by the opportunities of the future.

<u>**Anne Brodie – Metro News**</u>

_Project X_ (2012)  
As much as Daniel Day-Lewis&#39; _Lincoln_ was the essence of great history-based filmmaking, _Project X_ took us home.  Suburban kids revolt and light up the neighbourhood, experiencing love, joy and unleashed power. It was exhilarating and launched the careers of the talented young actors.

_Nebraska_ (2013)  
Alexander Payne&#39;s rural meditation on family took great risks as a slow-paced story about old people, shot in black and white. But it is a jewel, a wicked mix of wit, irony, drama and poignancy, beautifully written, directed and acted.  Spectacular performances from the tiny ensemble.

_Nightcrawler_ (2014)  
Xavier Dolan&#39;s _Mommy__ _ripped our hearts out and _Wild Tales_ made us pay attention, but Jake Gyllenhaal&#39;s stunning work in _Nightcrawler_ wins thanks to Jake Gyllenhaal&#39;s stunning commitment to the part of a dangerously ambitious news shooter.

_The Revenant_ (2015)  
_The Revenant_ is a superior film. There are good movies and then there is _The Revenant_.  Dogged by extreme shooting conditions and requiring much from Leonardo Di Caprio and the rest of the cast, this transcendent Old West revenge tale may never be equalled.

_Moonlight_ (2016)  
_Moonlight_ is a beautiful work of art on all levels from music to performance and direction to its exquisite cinematography. So much about it is counterintuitive to our ideas about filmmaking, classical music heightens everyday life in a Miami ghetto, a drug dealing saviour is its heart, an unlovable mother neglects her ever-evolving boy. So much to savour.

<u>**Linda Barnard –**  **Toronto Film Critics Association / Alliance of Women Film Journalists**</u>

_Amour (2012)_  
Michael Haneke&#39;s surprising love story is an unblinking examination of aging, as a couple is forced to face their mortality and, unthinkably, life without the other. It happens to both, but only one is consistently aware and therein lies the heartbreak. As tender as it is wrenching, _Amour_ is sentimental in the right ways and remarkably free of melodrama.

_Her (2013)_  
In the 3½ years since its release, _Her_ has become even more relevant, feeling less sci-fi and more present day in its examination of how the technology designed to bring us closer indeed strips humanity. An old-fashioned love story for a new age, it&#39;s elevated by [Joaquin Phoenix](http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001618/?ref_=tt_cl_t1)&#39;s everyman Theodore.

_Boyhood (2014)_  
Exceptional performances carry writer-director Richard Linklater&#39;s 12-year odyssey about a boy&#39;s life. It&#39;s bracketed by his parents narrative as they navigate their marriage, breakup and new lives as individuals. Powerful and honest, it succeeds as a commercial film and a bold experiment.

_The Grand Budapest Hotel (2014)_  
I love Wes Anderson and I love this film for all its quirky charms and wonderful performances. The onscreen liberation of Ralph Fiennes to play oddball M. Gustave reveals an engaging, skilled comic actor. We&#39;d see it again in _A Bigger Splash_, one of my favourite films of 2016. The colourful production design is like one of Mendl&#39;s fanciful confections. To see it is to smile. A pure delight.

_La La Land (2016)_  
Poor _La La Land_. It was once loved. Now it has become rather fashionable to hate it. Perhaps because I grew up on an endless TV loop of musicals from Hollywood&#39;s golden age, I was struck by both is lush familiarity and fresh spirit. Visually stylish, rich with colour, it&#39;s romantic and escapist. Sometimes you have to quit looking for subtext and just dive in.

<u>**Bill Chambers – Film Freak Central**</u>

_Brooklyn_ (2015)  
A film about how you have to reconcile the fact that you can&#39;t make major life decisions without hurting somebody, somewhere--that&#39;s life. _Brooklyn_ is life.

_Take This Waltz_ (2012)  
The rare portrait of infidelity that isn&#39;t excessively dour and doesn&#39;t lean on a genre crutch, featuring a horny, humid Toronto that almost never gets captured on screen--not to mention the definitive use of &quot;Video Killed the Radio Star.&quot;

_This Is Not a Film_ (2012)  
The Iranian government has banned Jafar Panahi from making movies, but as they say in _Jurassic Park_, &quot;life will find a way.&quot; A riveting film (or &quot;effort&quot;) that almost wills itself into being.

_Under the Skin_ (2013)  
A staggeringly insightful essay on the power of beauty and the vulnerability of the exotic, contained in the vessel of a cerebral but often viscerally terrifying sci-fi masterpiece.

_Inside Llewyn Davis_ (2013)  
The antidote or B-side to countless rags-to-riches biopics--sometimes, talent and drive aren&#39;t enough. Hang me, oh hang me.

<u>**Jason Anderson – The Grind**</u>

_Toni Erdmann_ (2016)  
The decade&#39;s most perfectly executed comedy about work, family and false teeth.

_Force Majeure_ (2014)  
A perfect evisceration of male vanity and vulnerability – plus, like _Toni Erdmann_, it&#39;s very, very funny

_Holy Motors_ (2012)  
Unbridled, utterly gorgeous cine-delirium \*and\* it has a Kylie cameo.

_Leviathan_ (2012)  
Not the Russian one with the whale bones but the one with all the dead fish by the Harvard Sensory Ethnography Lab – the first and last masterpiece to emerge from the blessedly shortlived moment for GoPro cinema.

_A Touch of Sin_ (2013)  
Jia Zhang-ke goes pulp.

<u>**Jason Stettner – Gamer Headquarters**</u>

_The Grand Budapest Hotel_ (2014)  
My absolute favorite film of all time provides the best of Wes Andersen not only in terms of visuals, but in the magic of the charming and entertaining story. It&#39;s got every big name that&#39;s ever worked with Wes in the past and there&#39;s something new with every viewing.

 [_La La Land_](http://movies.gamerheadquarters.com/review75lalaland.html) (2016)  
I love musicals and I find that _La La Land_ is a masterpiece capturing that classic Hollywood feeling while providing an emotional modern story. The music is amazing and the film is filled with glorious colors that highlight every scene.

_Birdman_ (2014)  
A rather dark tale that follows an actor past his prime that is held to the standard of a worn out super hero that he no longer wants to be. Featuring many stunning long shots and some of Keaton&#39;s best work this is a great film.

_The LEGO Movie_ (2014)  
This one deserves great praise for being a film that surprised me on so many levels. I was curious what exactly they were going to do with a movie about LEGO bricks, but they created a strong universe with characters you care about and even had some surprising emotional aspects that made many go pull out their LEGO bricks to build.

 [_Hail, Caesar!_](http://movies.gamerheadquarters.com/review8hailcaesar.html) (2015)  
I&#39;m not sure why this one was so overlooked in 2016, it was a beautiful look at the golden age of Hollywood being a simple story about one man&#39;s job on a production studio plot. It had many interesting characters all doing their own thing and showed the creation of classic looking films.

<u>**Noah Taylor – Dork Shelf**</u>

_Killing Them Softly_ (2012)  
While there&#39;s nothing subtle about this low level crime story updated by Andrew Dominik to reflect America&#39;s financial crisis, there&#39;s something infinitely watchable about the ensemble&#39;s performances paired with the style and dark humour Dominik brings to the screen. James Gandolfini&#39;s completely inconsequential hitman is just one of several digressions that make _Killing Them Softly_ dynamic, even if it is trivial at times.

_Inside Llewyn Davis_ (2013)  
Has there ever been a character that embodies pathos better than struggling folk musician Llewyn Davis? The Coen brothers&#39; circular narrative is just one aspect that put Inside Llewyn Davis in a league of its own. The atmosphere created by Bruno Delbonnel&#39;s cinematography and the fully realized performances, particularly by Oscar Isaac in the lead, cannot be overpraised.

_Under the Skin_ (2013)  
This film lives up to its title in its Kubrickian take on alien abduction. Johnathan Glazer takes lots of liberties with the source material to make this a truly unique cinematic experience. Scarlett Johansson&#39;s largely silent performance pairs well with _Her_, released the same year.

_The Grand Budapest Hotel_ (2014)  
Just when you thought you were sick of Wes Anderson, he comes out with a film that somehow makes all of his annoying tendencies feel fresh and innovative again. In addition to its visual beauty, _The Grand Budapest Hotel_ manages to be equal parts comedy and tragedy.

[_Mad Max: Fury Road_](http://dorkshelf.com/2015/05/14/mad-max-fury-road-review/) (2015)  
Art, meet Entertainment. I know you&#39;re strange bedfellows, but somehow this franchise that lay dormant for thirty years brought you together in a beautiful ballet of sand and fire... we thought nothing would ever be the same, 2016&#39;s &quot;blockbusters&quot; proved otherwise.

<u>**Dave Becker – 2,500 Movies Challenge**</u>

5 - _Django Unchained_ (2012)  
Tarantino does it again with this witty, violent, and incredibly engaging western. A great cast and an equally impressive soundtrack helped make this one of QT&#39;s all-time best.

4 - _Train to Busan_ (2016)  
Despite the influx of zombie movies in the past 10-15 years, this Korean flick still managed to distinguish itself. A high-energy horror film that&#39;s as fun as it is frightening.

3 - [_The Perks of Being a Wallflower_](http://www.dvdinfatuation.com/search?q=wallflower) (2012)  
I went in expecting a very different kind of movie, and was genuinely surprised by this poignant, romantic, and life-affirming film.

2 - [_Birdman, or (The Unexpected Virtue of Ignorance)_](http://www.dvdinfatuation.com/2015/02/1650-birdman-2014.html)  
A perfect storm of creativity, with style to spare and excellent performances by Michael Keaton, Emma Stone, and Edward Norton. This one actually gets better each time I see it!

1 - _The Wolf of Wall Street_ (2013)  
Even at 70 years old, Martin Scorsese can still turn out an edgy, stylish film, with all the bells and whistles we&#39;ve come to expect from a guy I consider one of the greatest directors of all-time. DiCaprio is superb, and the movie is so well-paced that its 3-hour run time seems to fly by.
