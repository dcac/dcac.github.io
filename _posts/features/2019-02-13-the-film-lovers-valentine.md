We've put together a chained melody for that special someone in your life. It's a montage of one of our favourite movie tropes, and a super sexy reminder of what it means to have one lucky person by your side through thick and thin. In short, it's the ultimate Valentine video for film lovers.

Watch. Share. Spread the love.

Not every movie we found made the cut, and not every movie that promised the handcuff routine delivered on the promise.
