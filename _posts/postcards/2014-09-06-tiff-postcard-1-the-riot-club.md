Hot British bad boys certainly have (maybe not-so-niche) appeal. Even I was curious what female director Lone Scherfig would bring to _The Riot Club_, which Laura Wade adapted from her own male-centric play, _Posh_. And after the opening scene, which dives head-first into big breasts and unrepentant Renaissance debauchery through a wily sense of humour, I buckled up for a wild ride.

Too bad the film never really went there. Despite this early filmic treatment and _Wolf of Wall Street_-esque promise, the film doesn’t amount to much more than _The Skulls_ at Oxford. The play’s spatial limitation start to feel unnecessarily confined for the big screen during the climax (especially in the massive Princess of Whales Theatre, which signalled a certain importance for a press-only screening). But alas, it was all ultimately as disposable as the women the male characters talk about but rarely engage. To re-quote the them, I suppose there are films for today, and films for tomorrow. This was just a film for today.
