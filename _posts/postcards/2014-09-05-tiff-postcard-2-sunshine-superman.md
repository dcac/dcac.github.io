<p>I'm so so so sorry. I don't know what happened to me. Well, yes I do. I was rushing into the screening - pulled pork sandwich dripping in-hand - because I didn't want to miss a moment. Good thing, too, because the visual treats in Sunshine Superman come fast and early. You couldn't ask for a more visual subject than a documentary about the first BASE jumpers. Especially one that follows Carl, and accomplished director of (free-fall) photography.</p>

<p>So as I sat there being consumed by the story, I also had to wolf down some lunch. Quickly, too, so I could capture some quotes from these odd balls in the late 70s who parachuted off cliffs and buildings. And as the story reached it's ominous ending, I couldn't dare leave. Which is why, in the film's most dramatic and extended silent pause, I accidentally let one rip. Hard.</p>

<p>It's not in my head. People turned around three rows away.</p>

<p>So yes, I'm coming clean. If someone complains that the screening stunk, it wasn't the film. It was me.</p>

<p>Really sorry.</p>
