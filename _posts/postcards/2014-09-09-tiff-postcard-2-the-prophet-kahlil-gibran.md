The idea of an animated feature based on _The Prophet_, Kahlil Gibran's collection of poetic essays, was enough to spark my curiosity while selecting my festival fare this year. Though a few lines and passages from the book have stayed with me over the years, I'm not really one for poetry. It doesn't 'come alive' for me very easily. But today was the exception.

Part poetry reading, part art gallery tour, part Yo Yo Ma concert, the film compiles chapters from the book into animated segments, each rendered by different artists. All of this is framed around the central narrative of a young girl who befriends a poet and political prisoner. That said poet is voiced by Liam Neeson was, admittedly, another huge draw for me.

Gibran's text leaps to life in vivid colour, and my concern of too many things being attempted at once was soon forgotten. I realized it was best to simply succumb to the film's interweaving elements, absorb the richness of the imagery and sound, and process it all afterwards. Although the main narrative is initially weak compared to the individual segments, it builds into a thoroughly moving conclusion, leaving me, admittedly, a little teary-eyed as I emerged from the theatre.

Also, if you happen to know who I need bribe to get Liam Neeson to come to my house and read me poetry, please, hook a girl up.
