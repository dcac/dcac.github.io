What does the official opening night film say about this year's festival? Everything, really. Safe, standard, and, if nothing else, reliable. *The Judge* parallels my overall feelings about this year's line-up in both form and content. There are solid performances, a bevy of stars, a mix between moments of artistic flourish and populist appeal, and a well-worn script that teeters on being overlong without ever actually being boring.

Of course, we all know the opener plays a very particular role here. You want to set a celebratory tone, while only teasing what's to come. However, between the new get-tough-on-premieres stance and outright scoops by the New York Film Festival (taking both David Fincher and P.T. Anderson's new titles), I fear that the real story this year will be the films that you're not playing.
